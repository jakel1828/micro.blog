			 <p>‘Jake, you’re a big critic of generative AI. So you must hate it, right?’</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<p>I don’t hate technology. I hate the overhype and overselling. I want tech to stay in its lane.</p>
<p>I am the driver, not technology—even generative AI.</p>
<p>Yesterday I used Anthropic’s Claude to help me prepare for a phone interview.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask Claude to fabricate a resume. (I’d already submitted my resume anyway.)</p>
<p>I simply asked it to help me tighten some things up.</p>
<p>Want more details for how you can responsibly use LLMs to help in a job search?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve recently fallen in love with Manjaro Sway.</p>
<p>While things started great, my experiment <a href="https://jakelacaze.com/2023/12/25/can-a-macbook.html">using a 2012 MacBook Air in 2024</a> hit a bit of a snag. 4GB RAM can take you only so far these days. So I started looking at Linux distros to replace an unsupported version of MacOS I was able to install thanks to the <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/">OpenCore Legacy Patcher</a>.</p>
<p>I started with Linux Mint, which was great until it wasn&rsquo;t. And then I tried Debian XFCE, which resulted in the same. On both distros, the desktop would freeze at certain points, and the quickest fix I knew was to hold the power button until the laptop shut off, and then start the machine back up.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This issue very well may have been due to user error and no fault of Linux Mint or Debian. Maybe I could have found a solution if I were a little bit more of a nerd (something like using SWAP at installation).</p>
<p>Before I gave up on Debian, I had also installed <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> so that I could give tiling window managers another chance. This brief revisit led to my wanting to again try <a href="https://swaywm.org/">Sway</a>, which is basically i3 with Wayland support.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t know what all this means. I understand only in the most superficial terms. These technical terms are not the point of this post.</p>
<p>Eventually, I settled on <a href="https://manjaro.org/download/">Manajaro Sway</a> because I like how it&rsquo;s set up out of the box.</p>
<p>My (for now) settling on Manjaro Sway is noteworthy only if you go looking for opinions about Manjaro Linux in general. Because you&rsquo;ll find plenty people saying not to use Manjaro. That it&rsquo;s stupid to do so. That there are much better options out there.</p>
<p>And there might be much better options out there&ndash;much better options for them.</p>
<p>But, at least for now, Manjaro Sway has been the easiest option for me. That very well may change. But so far, so good.</p>
<p>If nothing else, I appreciate the option to overlay useful keyboard shortcuts that new users may forget, right on your desktop wallpaper.</p>
<p><img src="https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2024/287455411-d0f7427d-bcfa-4949-985a-6789235b5641.gif" alt="Manjaro Sway Linux desktop wallpaper with overlay of keyboard shortcuts">

<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lsquo;Look at that subtle coloring. The tasteful thickness. Oh my god. It even has a watermark&rsquo; - A sceenshot of the Manjaro Sway Linux desktop wallpaper with overlay of keyboard shortcuts, courtesy of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->project&rsquo;s GitHub repo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And this brings us to an often-overlooked point about Linux. What&rsquo;s good about it is what&rsquo;s bad about it: Choice.</p>
<p>Linux offers a nearly limitless number of choices. You have countless options just within the <a href="https://distrowatch.com/images/other/distro-family-tree.png">Ubuntu family tree of distros</a>. And when you consider most distros give the option to install multiple dekstop environments, your options grow exponentially.</p>
<p>When you have so many options, it&rsquo;s impossible to say which option any one person should or should not use, unless you are intimately familiar with that person&rsquo;s use case and comfort with new technology.</p>
<p>But online&ndash;and especially in the Linux world&ndash;you can easily find people shouting from the rooftops about why their opinion is the only right opinion, with only limited context and with no understanding of when their preferred distro may not work for someone else.</p>
<p>My advice is to keep trying different setups until you find the one that works for you. Yes, setting up multiple distros is annoying and time consuming. But you can reduce some of the pain of switching by learning how to back up and restore your <code>Home</code> folder using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-rsync-to-sync-local-and-remote-directories">rsync</a>.</p>
<p>In life in general, the loudest voices are often the ones you should listen to least. The wisest voices are often harder to find. The Linux world is no different. In fact, perhaps the Linux world is the worst example of this universal truth.</p>
<p>Fortunately, cooler heads can be found, even in the Linux world:</p>

</div>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve already said, what&rsquo;s great about Linux is what&rsquo;s bad about it. But let&rsquo;s focus on the positive side. Linux offers an abundance of choice. That means how I Linux is not how you have to Linux.</p>
<p>You can Linux your own way.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jakelacaze.com/2024/04/21/mobiscribe-wave-the.html">MobiScribe Wave - The e-ink writing tablet I want to recommend but can&#39;t</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jakelacaze.com/2024/04/21/mobiscribe-wave-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-04-21 12:36:43 -0500">Apr 21, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ll always appreciate the MobiScribe Wave as being the device that proved an e-ink tablet has a place in my life, but after nearly five months of use, I&rsquo;ve realized I can&rsquo;t recommend the Wave to others. Or, perhaps more accurately, I can recommend it only with specific caveats and to a specific type of person with a specific mindset and specific expectations (basically anyone who&rsquo;s looking for an affordable e-ink writing tablet, and who doesn&rsquo;t mind dealing with some tradeoffs).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the issues that make this device all but impossible to recommend.</p>
<h2 id="my-problems-with-the-mobiscribe-wave">My problems with the MobiScribe Wave</h2>
<p>Most, if not all, of my issues with the Wave relate to the software.</p>
<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
<p>Some settings randomly turn off, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi</li>
<li>Google Play Store</li>
</ul>
<p>I could understand if the WiFi reset every time the device was restarted, though even that behavior would be unexpected. But I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve gone to do something requiring the internet (such as downloading an app from the Google Play Store or F-Droid<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), only to realize the WiFi had, for some unknown reason, turned itself off.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Google Play Store, the app often disappears from my app listing. Fixing this issue requires opening the settings, selecting the <strong>Play Store</strong> category, and then clicking a button titled <strong>Google Play Store</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Re-enabling the Google Play Store is <em>especially</em> annoying if you do it right after re-enabling the WiFi.</p>
<h3 id="pdf-reader">PDF reader</h3>
<p>In the Cons section of my original post on the MobiScribe Wave<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, I mentioned that the PDF app often opens a previously opened PDF file instead of the PDF file you selected. Fixing this issue requires closing the PDF app and then re-loading the file you wanted to read. While the fix is easy, it&rsquo;s annoying, especially considering the issue appears to have become more common throughout my usage.</p>
<p>Another issue with PDFs concerns disappearing annotations.</p>
<p>Sometimes annotations may reappear; but more often than not, they appear to be gone forever.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m not the only one who&rsquo;s had this issue. See the video below for proof, and a visual explanation of the issue.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/37uWke3zCeA" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>One last note about the PDF reader: After the most recent firmware update, the erase button on my Lamy AL-Star stylus no longer works. I now have to select the erase option in the PDF toolbar, which is especially annoying if I&rsquo;m viewing a PDF file in fullscreen mode (meaning the toolbar is hidden). I then have to exit fullscreen to the reveal the toolbar, select the erase option, and so on and so on . . .</p>
<p>Before the update, I could cut these extra steps by simply pressing the erase button on the side of the stylus. But the removal of this option now makes reduces the value of additional features some styluses may offer.</p>
<h3 id="lock-screen">Lock screen</h3>
<p>When I had a security PIN activated, the device would randomly lock, sometimes while writing or annotating. And sometimes it would lock mere seconds after unlocking the device.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, I decided to disable the lock screen and not write anything too secretive. This &lsquo;solution&rsquo; makes the device less useful.</p>
<h3 id="battery">Battery</h3>
<p>The battery life on the MobiScribe Wave is not great. I don&rsquo;t know if this is due to a hardware limitation (the capacity of the battery) or if the software isn&rsquo;t properly optimized for the device. Either way, the battery life is underwhelming.</p>
<p>The good news is that I&rsquo;ve yet to have the device fully discharge in a single day. An iPad, on the other hand, would likely die after only a few hours of heavy use.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t expect the MobiScribe Wave to make it through two days of heavy use without a recharge. (One bit of good news: In my experience, the device can easily remain charged for multiple days if idle and unused).</p>
<p>Consumers have come to expect more from e-ink devices in general. It&rsquo;s not crazy to expect e-ink devices that can go weeks between charges. And all the Wave&rsquo;s peers&ndash;such as the Kindle Scribe, Remarkable 2, and devices from Supernote&ndash;appear to offer devices that knock the Wave out of the water in terms of battery life.</p>
<h2 id="its-gonna-be-a-no-from-me-dawg">It&rsquo;s gonna be a &lsquo;no&rsquo; from me, dawg</h2>
<p>All the issues above (and maybe even some others I forgot to mention) make the MobiScribe Wave nearly impossible to recommend. I can&rsquo;t ask anyone else to part with his or her money for this device.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue to make do with mine. But this is an example of someone being only as faithful as his options allow.</p>
<p><em>Jake LaCaze now knows that an e-ink writing tablet has a place in his daily life. But he thinks his next will be something other than a device from MobiScribe.</em></p>

			 <p><em>What series of events&ndash;what algorithm&ndash;led to this bird in my tree?</em></p>
<p>I often ask this question any time I&rsquo;m entering or leaving my driveway.</p>
<p>A tiny owl of some sort has decided to make its home in a small tree in my front yard. The tree is really close to the driveway. I could probably jump up and touch the owl if I wanted to, though I wouldn&rsquo;t, because he very well may chomp off a finger. And I&rsquo;m quite fond of my fingers.</p>
<hr>
<p>📝<strong>NOTE:</strong> My family has taken to calling this bird Hootie. We&rsquo;ve also defaulted to referring to the owl as a <em>he</em>. We do not know the bird&rsquo;s gender and all inquiries into the matter have resulted in blank stares. Because the other members of my family value their fingers as much as I value mine, none of us has attempted a physical examination.</p>
<hr>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>Video proof of Hootie</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I simply cannot justify why this owl has made his home in the tree in our front yard. There must be far better trees he could have chosen. Trees with higher branches. With better coverage. And these far better trees aren&rsquo;t far away. Hell, he&rsquo;d need to look no further than the other side of our front yard.</p>
<p>Yet here he is.</p>
<p>For some strange reason, I feel honored that he&rsquo;s chosen our tree as his home.</p>
<p>Every morning and evening when I go to and from my car, I look up to see if Hootie is in the tree. And I can&rsquo;t explain the excitement I felt when one morning I looked into the tree and saw his eyes were <em>open</em> and staring back at me. Up until that point, I&rsquo;d only seen him with eyes closed as he snored away in broad daylight. Only a few mornings ago, my son who&rsquo;ll start middle school next year was excited to finally see Hootie&rsquo;s eyes open.</p>
<p>This whole situation makes zero sense for a couple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why is this bird here?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does my family care so much?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But we do. It&rsquo;s something out of the ordinary. It&rsquo;s a simple pleasure we&rsquo;ve learned to enjoy.</p>
<p>Yet when I think about this bird-brained situation, I can&rsquo;t help hearing in my head:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This does not compute. This does not make sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you had told me before this bird showed up that I could be excited about having an owl in my front yard, I would have laughed and said no way.</p>
<p>But the reality is there&rsquo;s no way I could have <em>optimized</em> for this experience. This experience was not on my radar. Yet it&rsquo;s something I look forward. It is, in its own way, inspiring.</p>
<p>This situation doesn&rsquo;t feel like optimization. It feels like serendipity.</p>
<p>But AI in the forms of social media engagement algorithms<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> have removed serendipity from our lives and have instead replaced it with the likes of the masses. These algorithms don&rsquo;t cater to your specific tastes. They offer the most mainstream versions of the content they think you&rsquo;re interested in, leading to a more-often-than-not generic experience.</p>
<p>Would AI have ever thought to put a bird in my front yard to make me happy?</p>
<p>Maybe, if you ask those who think human beings are just a bunch of data we&rsquo;re unaware of&ndash;and little more. Maybe the data was already there to pick through and make the call. But what if it wasn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>This does not compute.</p>
<p>Yet it is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so glad.</p>
<p><em>With each passing day, Jake LaCaze is learning to embrace the joys uncertainty sometimes brings.</em></p>

			 <p>All too often, we contemplate how we want to succeed.</p>
<p><em>What would you do if you knew you were destined to succeed?</em></p>
<p><em>Go do that.</em></p>
<p>So the wisdom goes.</p>
<p>But sometimes it pays to look at the other end of the spectrum. What if your venture is doomed to fail? For this thought exercise, assume there&rsquo;s no way to salvage things. You&rsquo;re going to fail, no matter what. The question is <em>how</em> you&rsquo;re going to fail. What will that failure look like?</p>
<p>What do you need to do to ensure you can be proud of your failure? When do you need to speak up? When can you take control?</p>
<p>Even if you have control of only 1% of the situation, that 1% is <em>everything</em>. So own it. And do so in a way that lets you hold your head up high when the whole operation blows up around you.</p>
<p>This line of thinking is more useful than daydreaming about immense success, leading to great disappointment when the success doesn&rsquo;t materialize. A pessimist might say my proposal dooms people to failure, because they&rsquo;re expecting things to go badly. But I disagree. The point of my thought experiment is to accept the possibility of failure so that you can focus on the process and conduct yourself in a way that makes you proud.</p>
<p>Failure is far more common than we like to admit. The vast majority of new businesses fail within only a few short years. Those who succeed do so because they&rsquo;ve stopped doing the things they were failing at. The beautiful thing about the failure-first mindset is that it ensures you&rsquo;ll be pleasantly surprised if you&rsquo;re wrong. Compare that to the feelings associated with being wrong when you lean into a success-first mindset.</p>
<p>As I recently heard paraphrased on an episode of <em>The Tim Ferris Show</em> featuring Morgan Housel<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happiness equals reality minus expectations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people claim failure is never an option. But I argue failure is often the default option. Perfectionism is a fool&rsquo;s errand. Working to become comfortable with failure is a far better use of time.</p>
<p>So, now I ask you:</p>
<p>What would you do if you knew you were destined to fail?</p>
<p>Go do that.</p>
<p><em>Jake LaCaze is highly successful at failing.</em></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In so many ways, the internet sucks.</p>
<p>Social media engagement algorithms have made it even harder to find quality content worthy of our attention<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. These algorithms don&rsquo;t push stories <em>you</em> care about. They instead push stories other people care about in the hopes that you&rsquo;ll fit into the same bucket as other consumers. They provide access to an abundance of content, but the content is often, quite frankly, <em>crap</em>. (Feel free to substitute a stronger word if you like.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only answer I&rsquo;ve found for these algorithms requires some work. We must take ownership of our own digital experience and curate the content we want to see. We can&rsquo;t afford to rely on the machines to inform or entertain us.</p>
<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve started using my MobiScribe Wave<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> as my own digital newspaper. Though the Wave is firstly an e-ink writing tablet, I appreciate that I can read and annotate interesting articles directly on a device I often keep at my side.</p>
<p>The rest of this post will give some insight into the tools and setup that help me curate my own digital newspaper. This post is intended as an overview, not as a comprehensive step-by-step guide, but I will do my best to include helpful links for anyone who wants to replicate my system.</p>
<h2 id="the-tools">The tools</h2>
<p>Below is a list of the tools I use to help me pay attention to the written digital content that matters to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>NewsBlur<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> (RSS service)</li>
<li>Syncthing<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> (Free, open source syncing service)</li>
<li>MobiScribe Wave (The actual e-ink device, powered by Android)</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi (This device works as a syncing hub and is optional to this workflow.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s take a look at how each device fits in.</p>
<h3 id="newsblur">NewsBlur</h3>
<p>NewsBlur, my RSS service of choice, is the most labor-intensive part of this process. Creating an account and signing up for the service are simple. But finding and adding feeds worth following takes time and effort.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with an RSS reader will expect NewsBlur to routinely update articles for any added RSS feeds. But NewsBlur has another feature that doesn&rsquo;t get enough attention: A dedicated email address for turning email newsletters into RSS articles<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with the wisdom of the statement <em>Crap in, crap out</em>, then you understand the importance of NewsBlur. If I put crap into NewsBlur, then I should expect to get crap out. Finding and curating content worth finding is the most difficult&ndash;but also most crucial&ndash;part of this process.</p>
<h3 id="syncthing">Syncthing</h3>
<p>Syncthing is your personal free and open source alternative to Dropbox.</p>
<p>I use Syncthing to sync PDF copies of interesting articles from my NewsBlur feeds into my MobiScribe Wave. Early on, I used Dropbox for this purpose, but I ran into some issues.</p>
<p>For one, the free tier of Dropbox didn&rsquo;t let me automatically save articles to my device, a crucial detail if I want to mark up and annotate the articles I read (which I sometimes do). This limitation meant I had to manually go into Dropbox and then save the articles to my device. This extra step led to managing two libraries: The files saved to my Wave, as well as those saved on Dropbox. <em>No bueno.</em></p>
<p>Without Syncthing, managing my digital articles was a nightmare, until the day I realized the MobiScribe Wave is an Android device, meaning it should work with Syncthing&rsquo;s Android app.</p>
<p>And so far, it has worked brilliantly.</p>
<h3 id="mobiscribe-wave">MobiScribe Wave</h3>
<p>At this point, there&rsquo;s little to add about the MobiScribe Wave. For the most part, I use the device as usual with the caveat that I must make sure the device is connected to the internet and that Syncthing is working to sync my articles.</p>
<p>I set up Sycthing on the Wave as I would any other device, allowing me to manage only <em>one</em> library instead of two, as I had to do when I was using Dropbox. For simplicity, I&rsquo;m syncing the Books folder on my Wave. Inside that folder I have subfolders for content types or statuses, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articles</li>
<li>Crosswords</li>
<li>Ebooks</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Finished</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>As I said earlier, the Raspberry Pi is optional in this workflow. I already had a Raspberry Pi and I&rsquo;ve found it valuable considering how I use it in this process. But I don&rsquo;t recommend you go out and buy a Raspberry Pi (or comparable device) if you don&rsquo;t already have one.</p>
<p>So how am I using it?</p>
<p>In my current set up, my laptop syncs with the Raspberry Pi. And the Raspberry Pi syncs with the Wave. But the my laptop and the Wave <strong>do not</strong> sync to each other.</p>
<p>Below is a simple illustration to show how my devices sync with each other.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2024/diagram-of-digital-newspaper-workflow.png" alt="A simple flowchart of my digital newspaper workflow"></p>
<p>My laptop and Wave <em>could</em> sync directly with each other. But I rarely have both devices online at the same time, so there&rsquo;s always a good chance they&rsquo;ll be out of sync.</p>
<p>I was already using a Raspberry Pi as a home file server. So I just took the minor extra step of setting it up as an intermediary between my laptop and the Wave. Now, I can save interesting articles into my synced folder on my laptop, whichh updates on my Pi. When I later use my Wave and connect it to the internet, the Pi then updates the articles on my Wave. And if I edit or delete a file on my Wave, my Wave then updates my Pi, which later updates my laptop. It&rsquo;s a thing of beauty.</p>
<h2 id="take-back-control-of-your-online-experience">Take back control of your online experience</h2>
<p>It would be nice if I didn&rsquo;t feel a need to go through so much work to make sure my time spent online isn&rsquo;t a complete waste. But recent history has shown that we can&rsquo;t rely on social media engagement algorithms to determine our experience.</p>
<p>Instead, we have to take charge. Yes, doing so takes some work. But setups like this can make it take just a little less.</p>

			 <p>Why should we create in the age of AI? How can we compete?</p>
<p><a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/building-a-stronger-web.html">This post</a> from LMNT puts a different perspective on things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I take a little comfort in knowing that it will be impossible for “AI” tools—here on out—to differentiate between human-made and machine-generated content, thereby inevitably feeding on their own regurgitations. It’s already happening, of course.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, while these “AI” companies try to sort that out (and fail), and search engines try to index only the sites that are what any reasonable person would consider genuine (and fail), the best thing we can all do is just create what we want while ignoring their problems, because they’re not our problems.</p>
<p>We have limited time and energy. Why spend it lacing our art with poison for AI scrapers? Why spend it focusing on how to stand out on platforms that can’t differentiate human-made from AI-generated? Why spend it publishing our new creations alongside AI-generated content? Don’t spend time on these things. These are all just busywork tasks that slow us down from doing what we really want to do: create.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on what you&rsquo;re creating, rather than worrying about AI, you might be better off asking, <em>So what</em>?</p>
<p>So what if AI is trained on my creations? Sure, I don&rsquo;t like the idea of it, but what&rsquo;s the real point of creating? On one hand, the act of creation is for me. For an example of what I mean, look no further than the audio I&rsquo;ve started adding to my recent blog posts. The point is not to start a &lsquo;podcast&rsquo;. The point is to make myself read my posts. When you read your posts, sometimes you realize your writing sounds strange. Also, I like to think that it&rsquo;s a way to dip my toes into public speaking, a skill I want to improve on.</p>
<p>Sure, AI can copy my voice and my writing and steal some of my fire online. But that doesn&rsquo;t affect me as a person <em>offline</em>.</p>
<p><em>Online</em> is a part of my life. But it&rsquo;s not my whole life.</p>
<p>And I agree with Louie Mantia (LMNT) that AI will soon start cannibalizing its own content, greatly hurting future quality. This is a concern I addressed on another version of my blog. It seems that generative AI is destined to best itself. So let&rsquo;s stop worrying about it and instead focus on creating.</p>

<p>Today’s target for artificial intelligence (AI) seems to be artificial general intelligence (AGI), a technology that is competent in many areas, like humans. AI is most often highly-specialized, focusing on one area with a narrow set of tasks. This sort of AI is best-suited for specialized audiences needing specialized tasks. But with AGI, the prophets of AI can achieve their dream: AI for everyone, everywhere.</p>
<p>Or so the prophecy claims.</p>
<p>We very well may achieve AGI, but I’m skeptical we’ll get there in the next decade (which, compared to the estimates from the prophets of AI, is an eternity). The simple truth is that we still know so little about how the human brain works. Regardless of how some may feel about humans, our brains are complex machines, calculating far more than given credit.</p>
<p>The developers of AGI seem hellbent on replicating and/or replacing humans. But can you replicate or replace what you don’t fully understand? Supplementing and improving upon human intelligence seems a far better goal. This is why I prefer the concept of augmented intelligence over AGI<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with SMART goals knows that goals should be attainable—that’s the ‘A’ in ‘SMART’, after all. And I’m not convinced that replicating or replacing human thought and processing will be attainable in the near future.</p>
<p>If Gary Marcus is right—if the hype seems to be dying and the return on investment just isn’t there<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>—then it feels as if AGI will be attainable much, much later than the prophets of AI would have us believe.</p>

<p>Some people want to be left alone to do their own work and go home and call it a day. There’s nothing wrong with that—I support your right to curate your own experience. But by working in such fashion, there’s only so much you can do.</p>
<p>There are only so many hours in a day, you have only so much energy, there are only so many tasks you can give your attention to.</p>
<p>At some point, you as an individual hit a wall. You’ve largely gotten as good as you’re going to get. Any improvements will likely be incremental and lower in impact than previous improvements.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in this position, maybe it’s time to start looking beyond yourself. Maybe it’s time to see if you can help others within your team—however you define that term—improve in the areas that hold them back.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s time to mentor. To scale your impact and elevate those around you.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s time to lead.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jakelacaze.com/2024/02/15/douglas-rushkoffs-survival.html">Douglas Rushkoff’s ‘Survival of the Richest’ shows how delusional the tech billionaires really are</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jakelacaze.com/2024/02/15/douglas-rushkoffs-survival.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-02-15 22:12:33 -0500">Feb 15, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I could try to tell you what exactly Douglas Rushkoff’s <em>Survival of the Richest: Escape Fantasies of the Tech Billionaires</em> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is about via a traditional book review, or I could hope that an inspired rant might give you a better idea. If you haven’t already figured it out, I’m choosing the latter route.</p>
<p>The tech billionaires have one simple goal: to shelter themselves from the world they’ve shaped with their outsized wealth, power, and influence. Undoing all they’ve done in the name of making true positive change via small incremental improvements that risk going unrecognised is beyond them. Simply having the option to escape this world via one avenue or another shows that the tech billionaires already live in a reality far different from the one most of us inhabit.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-ways-can-one-hope-to-escape">How many ways can one hope to escape?</h2>
<p>Rushkoff starts by describing the struggles of those tech billionaires outfitting their doomsday bunkers for the coming apocalypse<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. A lot of thought goes into such preparation. Location, supplies, air filtration. The tech billionaires are also looking into how to motivate their security to protect them when the markets collapse and currency is worthless.</p>
<p>Others hope to one day leave the earth behind. They plan to colonize Mars and start over new, where they’ll stand to gain even more as the early adopters of a fresh society.</p>
<p>But what about those tech billionaires who can’t escape in these ways? What if they have no choice but to stay on this boring earth, and what if everything doesn’t go to absolute hell and they can’t justify  running away to their bunkers in Hawaii or New Zealand?</p>
<p>That’s where digital escapes like the Metaverse come into play. Who needs Mars or a doomsday bunker when they can build a digital world to replace the physical. You can always buy digital real estate and rent it out to supplement any losses realised from your real estate in the unplugged world<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Some might call this strategy ‘diversification.’</p>
<h2 id="one-foot-out-the-door">One foot out the door</h2>
<p>Can you be tied to the world around you if your mind is set on escaping? Are you invested in the slightest? If the answer is no, then why do we let these select few build a world we’ll be stuck with when they flee the first chance they get? If you already have one foot out the door because you’re convinced that to stay is hopeless, then at what point is reality a foreign concept? And if you’re so sure that a certain outcome is inevitable, when does everything begin to look like a prophecy? And when do you decide that resistance is futile? You might as well get what you can while you can. Just make sure you get enough to help you get away at a later date.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can’t blame the tech billionaires for looking forward to their own big exit, when their investors expect their own such exit, usually in the form of an IPO or flipping the company at some multiple of their original investment.</p>
<p>Many in tech have long adopted Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra to ‘Move fast and break things.’<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> But tech’s secondary mantra appears inspired by Matthew Good<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ll stick to the plan:</p>
<p>The fall of man</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tech billionaires aren’t worried though, because as man falls, they will rise, whether to Mars, the Metaverse, or to the safety of their underground bunkers.</p>
<p>No big deal though. I’m sure they’ll wave bye and give a heartfelt thanks for all we’ve done to enable them to get the hell out of Dodge as they leave us to our fates<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>

		<a href="https://jakelacaze.com/2024/01/11/the-song-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-01-11 19:27:18 -0500">Jan 11, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Companies want customers to be passionate about their products and services. And they want employees to give <em>everything</em> to their daily labor. Companies want everyone else around them to be inspired, yet so many companies follow the industrial model in a race to the bottom, doing as little as possible to actually <em>inspire</em>. But inspiration doesn&rsquo;t just happen. It&rsquo;s hard to come by. It often takes work.</p>
<p>Seth Godin has long been the voice against corporate conformity. And Godin continues his crusade in <em>The Song of Significance</em>, in which he reminds us that business doesn’t need to be only transactional. Good business goes beyond the simple exchange of cash for goods and services. Good business is an exchange you wouldn’t mind doing again—one you might even look forward to.</p>
<p>Good business inspires, much like art. For many of us, our day jobs—where we spend a great deal of our waking hours—is the best chance we have to be artists.</p>
<p>These points have long been part of Godin’s message. In many ways, the contents of <em>The Song of Significance</em> are nothing new. The book’s central message will be familiar to any fans of Godin’s previous work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The race to the bottom is hard to win. And winning it rarely leads to positive outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we need to be reminded of our values—that we’re not alone—especially when the rest of the business world seems to go in the other direction.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, Godin reminds us that humans are the entire focus of business:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans are not a resource. We are not a tool. Humans are the point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Godin acknowledges that industrialism isn’t going away. But industrialism isn’t the only option. Workers and customers alike want something different. Something more. Something of significance. Businesses win big when they stop holding workers and customers hostage and instead create something both parties want to be part of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a field where skills are valuable and switching jobs is possible, the employees you need the most have options. That’s why creating a culture of fear and compliance is a dead end. Great work creates more value than compliant work.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>A significant organization can please its customers and make a profit as well. But it begins by earning enrollment and then doing the work to make change happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Godin’s other books (and his blog posts<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), <em>The Song of Significance</em> is not a how-to guide. It is instead a call to action. A call to action for us to pick ourselves and do work that matters.</p>

			 <p><em>The best part about the internet is sharing. And sharing is caring.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>If you enjoy this blog, maybe you’ll also enjoy the content that informs and influences it. You can obviously find such pieces in the sources I link to in the footnotes of my posts. But those links show only the most obvious influences. Sometimes something we read or watch or listen to plants a seed that germinates for a long time, meaning we forget where it all started.</p>
<p>The sharing of ideas and perspectives has always been my favourite part of the internet. I’ve always seen the Internet as my gateway to thinkers and thoughts I’d otherwise not have access to. And as long as I’ve been on the internet, I’ve enjoyed sharing the interesting things I find as well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, social media&ndash;thanks in part to social media engagement algorithms<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>&ndash;is no longer an ideal place for sharing, as the platforms make it harder to share content that diverts eyeballs from their own domains, because they want to keep users glued to their services as long as possible.</p>
<h2 id="enter-the-linklog">Enter the linklog</h2>
<p>This weekend I migrated my RSS feeds from Miniflux<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> to Newsblur<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> At $15 a year, Miniflux is a <em>great</em> option if you want a barebones RSS feed manager. My migration back to Newsblur was more a product of my own restlessness than anything Miniflux did or did not do.)</p>
<p>Aside from managing RSS feeds as you’d expect, a premium subscription to Newsblur ($36 a year) gives you a ‘Blurblog’ (their version of a linklog<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>), a simple site where you can share posts from your RSS feeds.</p>
<p>I’ve thought about adding a microblog to my site, but adding new content via Hugo is annoying for that use case. I’d have to create a .md file for each entry and push to GitHub for every single microblog post.</p>
<p>Even though I’m trying to run lean these days by hosting my site on GitHub Pages, I feel the inclusion of the Blurblog/linklog helps justify the extra cost of Newsblur vs. Miniflux.</p>

			 <p>When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</p>
<p>The tech industry is sthe ultimate hammer in that it thinks tech is the best
solution for every problem<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>And many businesses buy into the tech industry&rsquo;s thinking, as they scramble for that Holy Grail,
that one SaaS solution to rule them all and bring order to the chaos.
So they run out and sign a contract and spend months and years importing
their data and working with their vendors to make templates and custom
reports that fall short of what the nice salesman promised them. The
luster wears off and the company concludes they adopted the wrong system,
so they start the process over again.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple years and they&rsquo;re back at the beginning of the loop,
resuming the search for that one perfect solution.</p>
<p>What if the problem lies not in the tech but in what the tech is being
tasked with—AKA <em>the processes</em>?</p>
<p>How much of what the tech is doing actually needs to be done? How many
of those tasks could be removed?</p>
<p>Tech can work only if your processes and workflows are in order. By
getting a hold of your processes and workflows, maybe you&rsquo;ll reduce the
need for tech in the first place.</p>
<p>And by removing steps—by practicing addition by subtraction—maybe you
strike a better balance.</p>
<p>In terms of productivity and efficiency, we&rsquo;re often too easily tempted
to do more. American hustle culture gravitates toward the logic that
more activity is the ideal solution. But sometimes the secret to doing
more starts with doing less, or at least being mindful about what we&rsquo;re
doing and should be doing.</p>
<p>And we can often practice such mindfulness no matter what&rsquo;s in our tech
stack.</p>

			 <p><em>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s ahead for tech in 2024. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I won&rsquo;t be thinking about it.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>A career in the volatile oil and gas industry has cured me of any thoughts on making bold predictions. So instead I’ll look at what may happen (instead of what I think will happen) and what I’d like to happen for tech in 2024.</p>
<h2 id="will-the-generative-ai-bubble-burst">Will the generative AI bubble burst?</h2>
<p>It’s too hard to say if the generative AI bubble will burst in 2024. But I certainly hope it will. My reasons have been well-documented on this site. For one, I fear the developers of generative AI are too busy trying to sell their non-human-focused solutions rather than solving problems that could help real people<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If a career in oil and gas has taught me one thing, it’s that ‘boom’ is often another word for ‘bubble.’ And bubbles burst eventually. 2023 brought a great boom for generative AI. Might 2024 bring the bust?</p>
<p>Fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the bubble does burst. <em>What follows?</em></p>
<p>What will the shakeout look like? What developments will stick around?</p>
<p>The internet didn&rsquo;t go away when the dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s. The internet itself wasn&rsquo;t a total waste; there was just a lot of fat that needed to be trimmed so that we could focus on the useful parts.</p>
<p>The same logic applies to AI.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of us can get behind the thought of AI having an impact beyond the burst of the bubble. But as Chuck Klosterman pointed out in <em>But What If We&rsquo;re Wrong?</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, we run into problems when we try to get more specific with such prediction.</p>
<h2 id="is-2024-the-year-to-regain-control-of-your-digital-home">Is 2024 the year to regain control of your digital home?</h2>
<p>With the rise of social media, personal homepages became less important.</p>
<p>But now with the chaos of Twitter/X, many people are re-thinking their stances on owning their digital home spaces. Many of those same people don’t want to trade one dumpster fire for another by leaning on Meta-owned platforms. So they&rsquo;re looking for niche, sometimes indie, solutions.</p>
<p>Many are opting to invest in homepages again.</p>
<p>I spent the last quarter of 2023 setting up my own digital home at jakelacaze.com. 2024 is the year I’ll settle in and hopefully more consistently blog (and maybe include other types of content).</p>
<p>I don’t know if I’ll ever abandon social media. LinkedIn helps with finding new jobs. And experimenting with platforms like Bluesky adds variety to the online experience. But I know my own webpage should remain my digital focus and that I should use other tools only insofar as they don’t distract me from my own platform.</p>
<p>I hope more people will join along so that we can make the web weird&ndash;and therefore, <em>fun</em>&ndash;again.</p>
<h2 id="could-logseq-be-a-useful-personal-knowledge-management-system">Could Logseq be a useful personal knowledge management system?</h2>
<p>I’ve given Obsidian many tries over the years, but for some reason, it never quite stuck for me.</p>
<p>In December I tried Logseq and am so far loving it<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Logseq and Obsidian largely do the same thing: They both act as a ‘second brain’ where you can dump information so that you can use your limited brain power on the hard stuff.</p>
<p>While Obsidian is designed around individual pages, Logseq instead focuses on bullet points. Perhaps because I once tried the bullet journal method<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, thinking and organising information in terms of bullet points makes sense to me.</p>
<p>I hope Logseq can prove to be a tool worth the time.</p>
<h2 id="heres-to-hoping-you-find-a-way-to-make-tech-work-for-you-in-2024">Here&rsquo;s to hoping you find a way to make tech work for you in 2024</h2>
<p>The tech industry has a habit of making us bend to the tech they build.</p>
<p>I urge you to instead look at how you can bend tech to work around you. Maybe that requires rethinking how you use tech. Maybe it requires simplifying usage. Or maybe you&rsquo;ve already got everything perfectly figured out.</p>
<p>Either way, I see little harm in our being more thoughtful about the digital tools we use on a daily basis.</p>

			 <p><em>If you move fast and break things, do you ever come back to clean up your mess? Or do you just look for the next thing to smash?</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The October 2023 cover of <em>Wired</em> magazine irked me the moment I saw it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On one hand, the cover irked me because it seemed to be saying that we, the commoners, are at the mercy of the lords of AI (let’s just scratch out ‘overlords’ for the sake of accuracy). And it bothered me, on the other hand, because there seems to be truth in the sentiment.</p>
<p>Why shouldn’t the lords of AI mold our future, since the tech industry has had its way so far in the 21st century?</p>
<p>But don’t we have enough evidence of why it’s a bad idea to let tech call all the shots?</p>
<p>We’ve already seen what happens when AI has free rein.  All we have to do is look at the algorithmic wasteland that is now social media<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Tech moved fast and broke a lot as it formed social media. But tech has yet to go back and fix the mess it created along the way.</p>
<p>And why should they? What’s their incentive? Companies exist to make money. Tech companies are no different. Nor should they be. But when you consider the reach of the industry’s influence (empowered by a hands-off approach from regulators), is it wrong to ask tech to be a better steward?</p>
<p>Leaning on AI in the form of algorithms has seen the internet flooded with example after example of misinformation and disinformation, making respectable journalism even harder to find in the 21st century. And as a recent lawsuit from <em>The New York Times</em> brings to light, the tech industry is at risk of doubling down on its prior negligence<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.  But, as is the case with social media, it’s not worth their time to go back and pick up the pieces. So, they never will.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-we-trust-these-same-companies-to-break-more-stuff-with-generative-ai">Why should we trust these same companies to break more stuff with generative AI?</h2>
<p>Tech needs a better guiding principle than ‘Move fast and break things’, one that recognizes the responsibility that comes with disruption.</p>
<p>Remember when your elders told you to leave things better than you found them? Why shouldn’t that wisdom apply to tech as well? Or when your mother said told you it’s not what you say, but how you say it?</p>
<p>The mantra ‘Move fast and break things’ has horrible implications. Why not focus on fixing things, a far more constructive act? Breaking for breaking’s sake doesn’t serve anyone, especially if we’re never coming back to build something better.</p>
<h2 id="tech-needs-better-philosophy">Tech needs better philosophy</h2>
<p>So many of tech’s problems seem to come down to matters of philosophy, in that the tech industry doesn’t properly value people beyond their potential to become customers who buy tech’s ‘solutions’ that may or may not actually solve a problem<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for tech to adopt the philosophy of moving fast and breaking things when the results will benefit them. The tech industry is like a toddler who runs around smashing vases and busting windows, with a parent trailing close behind to clean up and apologize for the mess. Who wouldn&rsquo;t love to operate in such a fashion?</p>
<p>AI in particular could benefit from adopting the simple philosophy below:</p>
<p><strong>Helping humans &gt; replacing humans</strong></p>
<p>When we talk about creating or improving company cultures, many of us will utter the phrase ‘It starts at the top,’ meaning it starts with the people in charge. But I’d argue that truly great companies go one step further and start with a company’s ideals, which have the potential to stick around longer than any human employee can. And everyone who joins that company should be expected to adopt those ideals, because the ideals themselves, not who’s in charge, are the focus.</p>
<p>Tech needs better philosophy. Stoicism is great, but it’s not enough.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently sold a couple laptops (Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and Lenovo ThinkPad X270), so I was looking for another laptop to take to the coffee shop or on those rare occasions I go out of town. I didn’t want to break the bank, and while I was looking into how cheap/old of a MacBook I could make do with, I impulsively bought a 2012 MacBook Air 5,2.</p>
<p>So now I’ll definitely get some hipster cred while I’m sipping my mocha at the local cafe. But how well will the laptop serve me?</p>
<h2 id="price">Price</h2>
<p>I’ve wanted an Apple laptop for a while, but I couldn&rsquo;t justify the cost. Then I decided to take a chance with this old MacBook. Worst case scenario, I’d have a fun device for running Linux.</p>
<p>So I ended up with this MacBook Air from eBay for ~$106, after shipping and tax.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My purchase was a bit hasty, and I’m sure I could have found a better deal if I’d taken my time. But oh well, here we are, so let’s focus on what we&rsquo;ve got and not what could have been.</p>
<p>I considered a Chromebook but wasn’t sure if I really wanted to move into that ecosystem, especially because I’m already partially in the Apple ecosystem. Chromebooks regularly come with only 4GB RAM and low-powered CPUs, and chances are they’ll still cost you at least $200.</p>
<p>I also considered getting an iPad, but the cheapest new iPad was ~$250 this holiday season. If I’d gone that route, I most likely would have bought a keyboard case to go with it, likely pushing me past $300 total.</p>
<p>I could have come up with the money for something I truly <em>needed</em>. But this was more of a toy purchase. I had some money burning a hole in my pocket after I sold my Nintendo 2DS, so I was happy to pull the trigger if I could basically break even. But I didn&rsquo;t want to spend much more than what I&rsquo;d made by letting go of a device I rarely used.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see what I got.</p>
<h2 id="loose-specs">Loose specs</h2>
<ul>
<li>MacBook Air 5,2 (2012 model)</li>
<li>4GB RAM</li>
<li>128 GB SSD</li>
<li>1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 2.8GHz)</li>
<li>USB 3.0 (x2)</li>
<li>MagSafe charger</li>
<li>SD card reader</li>
<li>Headphone jack</li>
</ul>
<p>It ain’t got the shiniest features, but it’s got most (if not all) I need.</p>
<p>Many newer computers save space by abandoning USB 3.0 ports and using only USB-C ports. But I was surprised at just how sleek this pre-USB-C laptop still feels as we&rsquo;re leaning into 2024.</p>
<h2 id="condition">Condition</h2>
<p>You get what you pay for. So surely this thing must be falling apart, right? Not quite.</p>
<h3 id="cosmetics">Cosmetics</h3>
<p>I have a hard time believing this MacBook Air is over 10 years old.  I have to look hard to find the scuffs and scratches on the outer shell.</p>
<p>I can see a dent with the lid closed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But not bad for a laptop over a decade old that&rsquo;s had a few miles put on it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I can’t complain about the cosmetics of this laptop.</p>
<h3 id="battery">Battery</h3>
<p>I should have asked the seller about the condition of the battery. (And I wish the seller had disclosed that it needed replacing.) But I found a replacement battery for ~$30 on eBay. Replacing the battery was a breeze and probably took about 15 minutes. So all in all, not too shabby.</p>
<p>I seem to be getting around three hours of battery life between charges. That sounds weak when compared to newer laptops that routinely get well over 10 hours of battery life. But it&rsquo;s way better than what I was getting with the old battery (I might have been lucky to have gotten an hour).</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m rarely in a situation in which I absolutely must go more than three hours without charging. And if I&rsquo;m in such a situation, keeping my computer running is probably not high on my list of priorities.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h3>
<p>When people talk about old MacBooks, they often want to know whether the keyboard features butterfly switches or scissor switches. But when it comes to this keyboard, I instead find myself thinking about how I overlooked the fact that this keyboard doesn’t feature the standard American layout.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I bought some keyboard stickers for ~$6 on Amazon to help me out. And I’m adjusting to the small, oddly-shaped Enter key.</p>
<p>It’s not perfect, but it’s nothing I can’t adapt to.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-that-outdated-macos">What about that outdated MacOS?</h2>
<p>This MacBook Air is officially supported only up to MacOS 10.15.7 (Catalina), which received its last update back in July 2022.</p>
<p>For a while, I experimented with a few flavours of Linux. Solus OS was beautiful and smooth. But I got tired of dealing with the usual Linux issues. Certain apps aren’t available. I thought I could overcome the lack of iCloud support with the help of Syncthing, but every file change seemed to bring a wave of sync conflicts. I don’t want to put a ton of work into making Linux work for me on my personal desktop. I instead want to focus on writing and creating.</p>
<p>So I settled on MacOS. Thanks to OpenCore Legacy Patcher, I was able to update to MacOS 12.7.2 (Monterey)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I could have tried upgrading to Sonoma, but I decided to hold back to the oldest officially updated MacOS because this laptop has only 4GB RAM.</p>
<p>I’m quite impressed with the ease of installing an unsupported OS with OpenCore Legacy. So far, I have no issues to report. And it’s breathing new life into a perfectly capable device that Apple deems no longer worth updating.</p>
<h2 id="how-usable-will-this-macbook-air-be-in-2024-and-beyond">How usable will this MacBook Air be in 2024 and beyond?</h2>
<p>This laptop has some limitations, perhaps most notably the 4GB RAM.</p>
<p>4GB RAM may be fine for a Chromebook, but for most other computers, you really want at least 8GB. But if I’m honest about my needs, I could likely get by on 4GB RAM for a while yet.</p>
<p>The duo-core CPU is also a bit of a concern.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the RAM is soldered, so I can’t replace it. And replacing a CPU on a laptop is often equally hopeless. So I’m stuck with these limitations as long as I keep the laptop.</p>
<p>The good news is that I’d wager I spend 80% of my computer time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading RSS feeds.</li>
<li>Checking email.</li>
<li>Watching YouTube videos.</li>
<li>Writing.</li>
<li>Basic photo editing (resizing and cropping).</li>
<li>Updating my website.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it’s not as if I need a beast of a machine for my daily use. Sure, it’d be nice to have more power. But I think I’ll get by just fine. If I do need a more capable computer, I’m lucky to have a newer Mac mini available.</p>
<p>I expect this laptop to serve me well as a secondary mobile machine for at least a couple extra years, at which point maybe I’ll replace it with a machine from 2015. Maybe 2016 if I really feel like splurging.</p>

			 <p>There’s no such thing as the average person, or so the wisdom goes.</p>
<p>The logic says that if you were to create a profile of <em>the</em> average man or woman through a variety of factors—height, weight, income, weight, tolerance for Taylor Swift, etc.—you wouldn’t be able to find the real-live version of that person. (So, the next time your friend says they just wanna be average, let them know that they’re chasing one of the least attainable goals of all time.)</p>
<p>If the <em>average</em> human ideal doesn’t exist in flesh, might it exist digitally? This idea has stuck with me since I heard Dennis Yi Tenen make the following point about generative AI—more specifically, large language models (LLMs)—on episode 265 of Douglas Ruskhoff’s <em>Team Human</em> podcast<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a way, you’re having a conversation with an average . . . Imagine having a conversation with a thousand—or a hundred thousand—people, and I’m going to kind of average out the answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AI is math. A lot of math done really fast. But it’s math. While LLMs appear to be capable of thinking, they’re in fact just guessing with math. When answering a prompt, LLMs try to predict the best answer based on the most probable outcomes based on its training data.</p>
<p>So it appears that the developers of generative AI and LLMs have made <em>average</em> more accessible and more affordable, more quickly. And companies investing heavily into incorporating this technology into their everyday business may very well be investing a lot of time and money, and taking a lot of risk, for <em>average</em>.</p>
<p><em>Average</em> is not <em>smart</em>. <em>Average</em> doesn’t stand out. So, <em>average</em> is bad business. Might that same money be better spent on something that makes the business special and more competitive?</p>
<p>With the help of LLMs, we’re one step closer to codifying <em>average</em>. In a matter of seconds after prompting, we can see what the average answer looks like for anything we’re curious about. If you need help just getting by, then <em>average</em> may be fine. But innovation and insight don’t emerge from <em>average</em>. Any Seth Godin<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> fan knows that <em>average</em> is death for a business. <em>Average</em> means you can be easily swapped for another business.</p>
<p>Maybe <em>average</em> is fine for certain tasks that people are using LLMs for. But businesses should be sure that using generative AI helps them add real value elsewhere. Or, when all these businesses are using the same generative AI from the same small handful of vendors, they&rsquo;ll most likely sound like every business in their niche.</p>
<p>With the help of generative AI, it’s becoming easier to bring <em>average</em> to the masses. And if that’s all the AI community is doing, then how long until the bubble bursts and the industry falls back down to a healthier average in terms of valuation?</p>

			 <p><em>Integrating LLMs into your business may not be a quick fix.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) seem to be expensive, energy-hogging toys at this point. Some companies—most notably Microsoft—think integrating LLMs like ChatGPT into everyday business is a great idea. But I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>Below are some concerns I have for businesses going all in on LLMs.</p>
<h2 id="hallucinations">Hallucinations</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s well known that LLMs make stuff up (AKA they hallucinate).</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the root of these hallucinations? Will an LLM hallucinate with your business' proprietary data? Does the amount of data processed by the LLM affect its likelihood to hallucinate? If so, what is that threshold? How much time do you expect employees to spend validating the LLMs claims? Is that cheaper than having a human do the work in the first place? Who, outside of AI developers, wants to babysit an LLM all day?</p>
<h2 id="llms-are-terrible-at-math">LLMs are terrible at math</h2>
<p>Most business reports are math heavy. People use Micorosft Excel almost exclusively for calculations. But LLMs struggle with basic math. (I shared a simple example on LinkedIn recently.(<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>)</p>
<p>How can anyone trust an LLM to create crucial reports that may heavily rely on math? How can we know that the LLM understands these numbers?</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-train-an-llm-to-your-companys-style">How can you train an LLM to your company&rsquo;s style?</h2>
<p>LLMs are kind of like supercharged search engines. You put in a prompt (kind of like a search term) and you get a well-written answer. But what you get isn&rsquo;t perfect, even if it&rsquo;s 100% accurate.</p>
<p>LLMs tend to be verbiose and give way more information than needed (which also makes their claims harder to validate).</p>
<p>Every industry has its jargon, and individual companies may even have unique jargon.</p>
<p>How do these non-AI companies train LLMs for their needs and wants? How expensive is this training? How much time will it take?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jakelacaze.com/2023/12/06/can-the-internet.html">Can the internet ever be fun again?</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The internet isn&rsquo;t fun anymore. That&rsquo;s the claim made in a recent <em>New Yorker</em> article<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. A claim with which I agree.</p>
<p>So why isn&rsquo;t the internet fun anymore? Let&rsquo;s answer that by first looking at why the internet was fun in the first place.</p>
<p>In the early days, people were on the internet because they <em>wanted</em> to be. These early adopters were curious and adventurous, at least in a digital sense, so they experimented to see what the internet was, what it could be, and how they could help shape it. No one yet knew what would work. For better and for worse, there were no best practices. So people took chances and made strange sites that appealed to certain niches, thereby creating digital communities. And if you stuck around, you’d accepted that everyone you knew wouldn’t be on the World Wide Web. More than that, you embraced this fact. The uncertainty that accompanied not knowing what you’d find was a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>Compare those early days to the current state of the internet. People aren&rsquo;t on the internet because they want to be, but because they feel they <em>need</em> to be. For many of us, an internet presence is self promotional. We put the time in because we hope to get something tangible in return&ndash;something that shows our time &lsquo;invested&rsquo; was worth it. (For the record, this applies at times to your author. Otherwise, I wouldn&rsquo;t still have a LinkedIn profile.)</p>
<p>On today&rsquo;s internet, most people don’t want to spend time in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar faces. Most of us don’t want to start over with new social networks and new communities, in part because pursuing something new means taking time away from something you’ve built elsewhere. A couple decades ago, trying something new on the internet was a great example of having nothing to lose and everything to gain. Now, for many of us, the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Also, digital communities are harder to come by. Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube&ndash;these aren&rsquo;t communities. They&rsquo;re instead mega aggregators. People don&rsquo;t use these services because of a shared interest. They&rsquo;re on these services simply because they <em>are</em>. Because they&rsquo;re online. And now, thanks to the abundance of broadband Wi-Fi and smart phones, simply being online isn&rsquo;t the gatekeeper it once was.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder no one seems happy when the internet feels like a ubiquitous obligation? We&rsquo;re no longer online to have fun. Instead, we&rsquo;re like Marshawn Lynch&ndash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m just here so I won&rsquo;t get fined&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But Lynch, an NFL running back, was contractually obligated to attend interviews. So he made light of the obligation wherever he could. Most of us don&rsquo;t have to be online. But we feel as if we must, so we don&rsquo;t contribute to the community.</p>
<p>And then there are the issues of the look and feel of the internet.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The internet is now highly centralized, dominated by four of five major players. Any new platform that gains attention risks being acquired by one of the majors and maybe abandoned or shut down. And most sites sites not owned by the big players are plastered in ads and popups and autoplay videos, making the content you came for inaccessible, particularly on mobile.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The modern internet has been optimized&ndash;not for users, but for corporations. And as the great poet Cyndi Lauper warned us four decades ago, money changes everything.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Anything that gains a major following online and sticks around will most likely be monetized at some point, as it deserves to be. Maintaining these sites and services isn&rsquo;t free. So, is this just the fate of the internet for the most part? Was the era of fun a brief window in the late &rsquo;90s and early 2000s? Is it gone forever?</p>

			 <p>Nietzsche shocked the world when he declared God is dead. (<em>Kids in the Hall</em>, not so much<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>)</p>
<p>Now, digital philosophers hope to do the same when they declare the death of Twitter.</p>
<p>On one hand, Twitter will live on through X, whatever the hell that becomes. On other other hand, the essence of Twitter was gone long before Elon Musk bought the platform.</p>
<p>So what’s next? Most people are trying to answer this question by finding a comparable replacement. How can we fill that bird-shaped void in our souls? Mastodon is too confusing for normies. Bluesky isn’t open to the public and is still available only via an invite code. People seem to be over Threads, as usage has recently dropped over 80%.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Why do we need a one-to-one trade? Why do we need to replace one platform with another? What if we instead replace Twitter with something else completely?</p>
<p>Cal Newport recently quoted the author Neil Gaiman as admitting his own blogging, an activity he once enjoyed, had suffered due to microblogging via Twitter<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Gaiman doesn’t think any current platform will replace Twitter. If he’s right, then that means something unlike Twitter must replace it. What will that something be?</p>
<p>So many of us keep waiting for something to recreate the early vibes of Twitter. But what if Twitter was little more than a moment on the internet? What if that moment is simply gone, lightning that won’t strike twice no matter the platform?</p>
<p>The essence of Twitter was killed by the pressures of profit. Can any platform serve on the same scale while resisting those same pressures? Someone has to pay for these services, one way or the other. Servers and development ain’t free.</p>
<p>Maybe Twitter should serve as a warning sign of what’s most likely ahead for most platforms like it. And maybe we shouldn’t seek to replace Twitter but to find better, more niche alternatives.</p>
<p>Maybe <em>Small is the New Big</em> isn&rsquo;t just the title of a marketing book by Seth Godin<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Maybe it&rsquo;s also the future of the web.</p>

			 <p>My son and I were walking the dogs recently when somehow the topic of AI came up.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re preparing to become a parent, so many fears enter your thoughts. <em>How am I going to keep from screwing this little person up, and help him or her become a fully-functioning adult? How do I prepare this child for all the evils and threats of the world? How am I going to have THE TALK when the time comes?</em></p>
<p>Parents don&rsquo;t typically wonder how they&rsquo;re going to teach their kids about AI. Yet I found myself needing an answer for this concern as my son and I were trying to figure out if our little pooch Rio was just peeing, or if I was going to be on poop cleanup duty. Life comes at you in strange ways.</p>
<p>My first instinct told me to warn my son of the risks of blindly trusting generative AI, particularly large language models. So, I told him about the attorney who got caught referencing bogus court cases thanks to hallucinations from ChatGPT<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I also told him about my own experiences with ChatGPT&rsquo;s hallucinations. I once asked ChatGPT some questions about a then current employer. ChatGPT claimed the company had two offices in Europe, neither of which existed. This misinformation isn&rsquo;t the worst part. The more concerning fact is that ChatGPT went on to say that one office focused on marketing while the other focused on research and development. ChatGPT made up an elaborate story for something it knew nothing about.</p>
<p>Perhaps inspired by iA&rsquo;s approach to generative AI<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, I knew I&rsquo;d be doing my son a disservice if I simply told him not to use AI. Our children don&rsquo;t grow up in a bubble. Unfortunately, the outside world determines the norms they must navigate through. So, to some degree, we must teach our children to assimilate. Whether I like it or not, AI will be a big part of my son&rsquo;s future, so he must learn how to navigate the AI waters.</p>
<p>For parents, there are many fears for our children growing up in the age of AI. But there are also opportunities. Time is on children&rsquo;s side, as they can prepare for living in a world with AI and be ready to hit the ground running come time to enter the workforce.</p>
<p>We parents must instead find our footing in the quicksand. The least we can do is make sure our children don&rsquo;t have to do the same.</p>

			 <p><em>Like it or not, generative AI is here to stay. But writers don’t have to lose their voices to technology.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>iA writer has long been the writing app for writers. The company <em>gets</em> writers, as they’re constantly thinking of ways to remove distractions and make writing (and thinking) as simple as possible.</p>
<p>As you’re likely well aware, generative AI has been all the rage since OpenAI released ChatGPT just over a year ago. Too many apps are looking at ways to integrate with tools like ChatGPT, ignoring the fact they’re making their apps indistinguishable from others while letting their future success hinge on the decisions of another company.</p>
<p>As the company detailed recently on its blog<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, iA put a lot of thought into how to integrate with generative AI. They didn’t want to just pipe in ChatGPT and make their customers’ words obsolete, while also undoing all they’ve worked for and accomplished over the last 15 years. But the company also accepted that putting its head in the sand and refusing to acknowledge generative AI wasn’t an option. Many writers will choose to use generative AI in the future. And some will feel the pressure to use generative AI to keep up with those churning out content at the speed of a ChatGPT prompt.</p>
<p>iA chose to stand out from the crowd by making it easier for writers to distinguish their words from the words borrowed from generative AI tools such as ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Basically, iA writer has made it easy to compare what you’ve pasted (which will be greyed out) vs. what you’ve written (which will still be shown in the normal font color).</p>
<p>See the video below for a quick explanation of the major feature of iA&rsquo;s latest release, writer 7.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’m sure the implementation of this solution was simple. No complex algorithms. It’s nothing academics will write papers about.</p>
<p>But iA was able to find this solution only by doing the hard work of keeping their customers and their customers’ needs front of mind, while also remaining true to the brand they’ve worked so hard to build.</p>
<p>This simple feature is a masterclass in great tech marketing. iA clearly knows its audience&ndash;people who identify as <em>writers</em>&ndash;and the company has taken a novel approach to serving the true needs of their customers, not what iA <em>wants</em> customers to need.</p>
<p>Is iA’s approach to generative AI the right one? I hope and think so. But only time will tell. If nothing else, they deserve credit for the thought and effort they&rsquo;ve put into dealing with the challenges presented by generative AI.</p>

			 <p><em>The MobiScribe Wave isn&rsquo;t the best e-ink device out there. But it might be all you need.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Over the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with the MobiScribe Wave. Because the device is an interesting mix of value and compromises, you should do your research before you buy.</p>
<p>This post is less technical than you&rsquo;ll find on most other reviews. I hope to instead give practical perspective to inform your buying decision. The MobiScribe Wave is not a premium device in the same class as the Remarkable 2, Kindle Scribe, or Ratta Supernote. But depending on your usage, the Wave may be all you need.</p>
<p>While using the Wave as my main writing and reading device for the last month or so, I&rsquo;ve become well-acquainted with its limitations. But I still love the device despite its flaws.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-bought-the-mobiscribe-wave">Why I bought the MobiScribe Wave</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d had my eye on an e-ink writing tablet for a while now. But at times I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling I wanted one only because I wanted a new toy, and that buying such a device would be a waste of money.</p>
<p>Comparable e-ink writing tablets from MobiScribe&rsquo;s competitors are significantly more expensive than the Wave&ndash;some over twice as much, depending on what specs and accessories you get.</p>
<p>Later in this post you&rsquo;ll find a brief comparisons of the Wave and its competitors; hopefully then you&rsquo;ll understand why I was reluctant to splurge on a device I wasn&rsquo;t sure was truly for me. I was tempted to stick with old fashioned pen and paper. But the old ways weren&rsquo;t working out great on my morning and evening train commutes.</p>
<p>With physical notebooks, I struggle with keeping different types of writing separate in their own notebooks. But it&rsquo;s often more convenient to carry only one notebook. With the MobiScribe Wave, I can now have the best of both scenarios, at a great price.</p>
<p>With an e-ink notebook, I can switch between reading and writing in a snap, within the same device. And reading my writing partner&rsquo;s stories on my Wave is way easier than reading them on my tiny phone screen (iPhone SE). Also, on my phone, it&rsquo;s too easy to find something else to do with so many apps at my fingertips. So, for a while, I was printing my writing partner&rsquo;s stories out. Making notes on an 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; piece of paper is inconvenient at the best of times on the train, but even more so on those days where it&rsquo;s standing room only.</p>
<p>Having everything I need on one device cuts down on the number of items I carry in my laptop bag. Each book, notebook, pen, pencil, eraser, etc., adds weight and bulk. Maybe I&rsquo;d feel differently if I got to call my own shots and could work when and where I wanted. But I instead sold my soul to The Man, so the MobiScribe Wave is a great device for me.</p>
<p>I resisted the urge to buy an e-ink writing tablet for a while. But when Cal Newport kept singing the praises of his Remarkable 2 on the Deep Questions Podcast<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I could no longer resist. And a certain YouTube video from Voja of My Deep Guide<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> convinced me the Wave was worth taking a chance on.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-get">What you get</h2>
<p>Below is <strong>what you receive when you buy the MobiScribe Wave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The MobiScribe Wave e-ink notebook.</li>
<li>MobiScribe&rsquo;s standard Stylus.</li>
<li>Cover for the device.</li>
<li>USB-C cable for charging and file transfer (wall plug not included).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-primary-device">The primary device</h3>
<p>The primary device feels solid.</p>
<p>The back has indentions on the side which make it easy to hold.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d like having a recessed screen, especially because I&rsquo;d gotten used to a flush screen on my Kindle Oasis (before my wife decided she wanted to start reading again and basically stole my Oasis, thereby justifying my purchase of the Wave). But I&rsquo;m happy to report the recessed screen hasn&rsquo;t been an issue. In fact, I&rsquo;ve forgotten it&rsquo;s even an aspect of the device.</p>
<p>64GB of storage is very generous at this price point. More expensive devices come with much less storage.</p>
<p>The front light is one of those features that most e-reader fans likely take for granted. But, when you consider that no versions of the Remarkable 2 include a front light, you realize what a luxury it is.</p>
<h3 id="stylus">Stylus</h3>
<p>The stylus is fine.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read online, the stylus doesn&rsquo;t give as much feedback as the Remarkable 2&rsquo;s stylus, which may be an issue for some users. The good news is that the Wave is compatiable with most styluses that use Wacom EMR technology, so you can switch out for a better stylus if you like.</p>
<p>Having an eraser on the end of the stylus is nice. But I can&rsquo;t help wanting to rub when I erase&ndash;like you&rsquo;d expect to do with a pencil eraser&ndash;and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s how I scratched my screen. The scratches aren&rsquo;t bad and I don&rsquo;t find them distracting. But it&rsquo;s disappointing that I&rsquo;m already seeing cosmetic wear and tear after only a month of ownership.</p>
<p>I replaced the nib after three weeks of usage. I haven&rsquo;t had the device long enough to know if this will be the average lifespan for my nibs. Also, your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>After owning the Wave for a month, I bought the Staedtler Noris Jumbo stylus<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, which is much better at a great price (~$35). The stock stylus had stopped working as expected. For some reason, it would only erase, no matter what tool was selected. My research prior to buying the Wave did not lead me to believe it&rsquo;s common for the stock stylus to crap out so quickly. So I can&rsquo;t say you should factor the cost of another stylus into the budget/risk factor. I appear to have just run into a bit of bad luck.</p>
<h3 id="case">Case</h3>
<p>The case is simple, light, and functional.</p>
<p>The front cover folds around with no hitches, making the device is easy to hold with one hand. The pen loop ensures you never lose your stylus. Cutouts along the top and bottom edges give access to the charging port and buttons for power and the front light.</p>
<p>But how well does it protect the Wave? I haven&rsquo;t dropped it yet, so I can&rsquo;t really say. But the device isn&rsquo;t as fragile as an iPad, which uses a glasses screen, so I imagine the case works just fine.</p>
<h2 id="the-mobiscribe-wave-vs-similar-devices">The MobiScribe Wave vs. similar devices</h2>
<p>The complete package of the MobiScribe Wave can be tough to gauge. For $230, you get a complete bundle including the MobiScribe Wave, case, stylus, and USB-C cable.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s glance at <strong>how the MobiScribe Wave compares to its peers in terms of price and value:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$450 for the cheapest bundle (device, stylus, cover) from Remarkable</li>
<li>$275 for a refurbished Remarkable (device only); $299 for new (device only)</li>
<li>Nearly $400 for a comparable Kindle Scribe bundle (with only 16GB of storage)</li>
<li>~$550 for a similar bundle for the Supernote Ratta A5X (a comparable device to the Remarkable 2 and Kindle Scribe)</li>
<li>~$420 for a similar bundle for the Supernote Ratta A6X (comparable in size to the MobiScribe Wave</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The prices listed here are normal MSRP and do not account for potential sales. Also, you may save money if you don&rsquo;t buy a full bundle.</p>
<p>The Wave comes with 64GB of storage. The Kindle Scribe bundles start at 16GB. The Remarkable 2 has only 8GB of storage, with no expansion options.</p>
<p>The Wave includes a front light, which is not available on any of the Remarkable 2 devices at any price point.</p>
<p>None of the Wave&rsquo;s competitors claim to offer waterproof devices. (Is the Wave <em>really</em> waterproof? No idea, as I don&rsquo;t plan on testing that feature any time soon.)</p>
<p>The Wave lets you download other apps via the Google Play Store. This feature helps to make the Wave a more nearly complete reading device by making it easier to check in on your RSS feeds and saved articles. As far as I know, the Remarkable 2 doesn&rsquo;t let you download any extra apps. And Kindle wants to limit you to their store and ecosystem. With the Wave, you can read ebooks via apps including Kindle, Kobo, Libby, and Hoopla to name a few. If you care about other apps and doing things beyond reading and writing, then a full-fledged e-ink tablet from Onyx&rsquo;s Boox line may be more up your alley. But keep in mind the Boox devices are much more expensive than the MobiScribe Wave (and most of the other devices mentioned in this post).</p>
<h2 id="initial-setup">Initial setup</h2>
<p>After connecting to WiFi, I downloaded the tolino app for ebooks and the Adobe PDF app. You can download these apps from the MobiStore app&ndash;no account required.</p>
<p>Then I transferred my ebooks via USB-C and I was ready to go. (<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you&rsquo;re using a Mac, you&rsquo;ll have to download the Android File Transfer app. Sometimes I have to connect the device multiple times before the app works. I don&rsquo;t know if this issue is unique to the Wave, or if it&rsquo;s typical with most Android devices and Macs.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Since the original post, I have since transferred books via USB-C on Fedora Onyx, which was a much smoother experience, so Linux users may have better luck.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also enabled the Google Play Store on the device and have downloaded apps including Firefox and wallabag.</p>
<h2 id="how-ive-been-using-the-mobiscribe-wave">How I&rsquo;ve been using the MobiScribe Wave</h2>
<h3 id="as-a-writing-device">As a writing device</h3>
<p>Since I got the Wave, <strong>I&rsquo;ve used it for every version of writing I can think of:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Journal entries.</li>
<li>Short stories.</li>
<li>Blog posts.</li>
<li>Doodles.</li>
<li>Meeting notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve yet to find a reason to go back to physical notebooks and pens.</p>
<h3 id="e-reader">E-reader</h3>
<p>When it comes to reading, the Wave feels like a Kindle on steroids.</p>
<p>As you would expect, I can read ebooks on it. Most of the ebooks I read tend to be EPUB files. But I do read PDFs on the device as well. Being able to directly markup both EPUB and PDF files with my stylus makes it feel as if I&rsquo;m reading an old fashioned printed work, but with the benefits of technology.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve already mentioned, downloading a couple extra apps on the Wave lets me keep up with my favorite blogs. With Firefox, I can access miniflux (my RSS service provider) and with wallabag, I can catch up on my read-it-later articles.</p>
<h2 id="who-the-mobiscribe-wave-is-for">Who the MobiScribe Wave is for</h2>
<p>The Wave might be a great option for you if you&rsquo;re:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost conscious, whether generally or because you&rsquo;re not sure if you&rsquo;ll like this type of device and so don&rsquo;t want to spend too much.</li>
<li>Someone who&rsquo;s never used a premium alternative such as the Remarkable 2 or Kindle Scribe. (I haven&rsquo;t used any Remarkable or Scribe tablets aside from demoing them in the store, but in general, it&rsquo;s hard to take a step down if you&rsquo;ve had something perceived as being in a higher product class.)</li>
<li>Someone who commutes or travels and you&rsquo;re tired of carrying multiple books, notebooks, pens, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-the-mobiscribe-wave-is-not-for">Who the MobiScribe Wave is NOT for</h2>
<p>You may want to pass on the Wave if you&rsquo;re:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone who expects a premium experience or has already gotten used to a premium device.</li>
<li>Someone who doesn&rsquo;t understand the value of e-ink and may be better served by an iPad or similar full-feature tablet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>
<p>Below are some features that make the MobiScribe Wave a great value purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost - For $230, you get a writing tablet, stylus, cover, 64 GB storage, and more.</li>
<li>Great writing experience.</li>
<li>Access to apps like Kindle and Libby that extend your reading options.</li>
<li>Unlimited paper (and the flexibility of deleting, copying, inserting, and rearranging pages however you want or need).</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already covered why I think the Wave is a great value at $230.</p>
<p>I usually prefer more feedback when writing. The Wave doesn&rsquo;t give as much feedback as I get from certain fountain pens, but the writing experience is much better than writing on an iPad without a paperlike screen protector, which feels far too slick.</p>
<p>Being able to download extra apps extends the usefulness of the device, but I don&rsquo;t think you have to worry about it becoming as distracting as a smart phone or backlit full-color tablet.</p>
<p>And knowing you can rearrange your writing later gives lets you focus on getting your words down now.</p>
<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li>Battery life.</li>
<li>Laggy at times.</li>
<li>Pen doesn&rsquo;t attach magentically, so the cover is pretty much required. (On the plus side, the cover is light and thin.)</li>
<li>Glitchy (sometimes opens previous notebook or PDF rather than the file I most recently chose).</li>
</ul>
<p>The battery is by far the device&rsquo;s greatest disappointment. With heavy usage, the battery lasts over a day. But I&rsquo;m not sure it can make two days. We&rsquo;ve come to expect e-ink devices to last weeks between charges, so the shorter battery life feels like a major step back. If you plan on taking the MobiScribe Wave on a multiple-day trip in the wilderness, you might want to take a power bank with you&ndash;maybe one that can be recharged by the sun.</p>
<p>The Wave does lag sometimes. This usually results in me pushing a certain button twice and messing up what I was trying to do. In a perfect world, a device would never lag. But such a device will cost you much more than $230.</p>
<p>Sometimes I try to load a notebook or PDF, but a previously opened file pops up rather than the one I selected. Yes, it&rsquo;s annoying when it happens. But it can be fixed by closing out the app and then opening the desired file again. I&rsquo;ve never seen this bug repeat twice in a row. Hopefully the developers can fix it in the future.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-concern-about-customer-service">A note (concern) about customer service</h2>
<p>I mentioned earlier that the stock stylus stopped working as expected about a month after purchase.</p>
<p>Before I bought the replacement stylus, I emailed MobiScribe support to see if they had any troubleshooting tips for me. As of the time of this post, I have not received a response after a day and a half. Now that I know the stock stylus is the root of the problem, I&rsquo;ve followed up to see how I can make a warranty claim. I&rsquo;ll try to update this post with a more complete picture of the customer service experience when/if this issue is resolved.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> MobiScribe customer service got in touch with me. After a little back-and-forth via email and sharing a video of the problem, MobiScribe sent me a replacement stylus free of charge. Thank you to MobiScribe for the handling of this issue.</p>

			 <p><em>As we rely more on AI, aren&rsquo;t we at risk of sounding just like everyone else?</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The prophets of AI continue to promise their favored tech will make our lives easier. Thanks to AI, more of the things we want are only a click or a prompt away. You can now inject AI wherever you want, as AI can help you with writing, creating music, and editing images, as just a few examples.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fault anyone for using these offerings, especially because I have used them in my own way and will continue to do so at different points in my life. But I still have concerns. At what point does technology rob us of originality&ndash;and when is that scenario okay, and when is it not?</p>
<p>Should we be concerned about the loss of originality in terms of cold hard facts? We likely don&rsquo;t care about originality when it comes to complex math&ndash;think balance sheets and revenue forecasting. In those cases, the work to get those numbers isn&rsquo;t the point&ndash;deciding what to do with information is the point.</p>
<p>But what about fields we&rsquo;ve traditionally considered more artistic? Fields like writing, music, and graphic design. In such fields, there&rsquo;s not so much separation between the process and the end result. So, the process is more largely <em>the point</em>. What you choose to include or exclude may be subjective. These decisions are part of your style, one of the more crucial aspects of art. Number crunching doesn’t leave much room for style. But the arts are all about style.</p>
<p>As we remove ourselves from the creative process and forfeit agency to AI and algorithms, at what point are we enabling the erosion of style?</p>
<p>The prophets of AI will say that AI tools can unlock creativity previously unrealized. Maybe that&rsquo;s true for a small segment of people. Call me cynical, but I imagine few will put in the time to learn how to improve results from prompts. Most will put in minimum effort and take whatever AI gives them, leading to an ever-more homogeneous internet. The future is more likely to be less original. The tools meant to empower us will instead make us all the same.</p>
<p>People probably don&rsquo;t expect numbers to have personality and quirks. But we expect these personal touches from artistic projects.</p>
<p>Art goes beyond having the right answer. Art is also about the habits of the artist&ndash;AKA style. Style is the artist&rsquo;s most-cherished asset. Style is what makes the audience relate to the art and the artist.</p>
<p>As we further integrate AI into art, are we at risk of losing those stamps of authenticity we unknowingly put in our work? Those little hints that remind our audiences that we&rsquo;re the authors of our own works? And if style is the most valuable thing we have, are we smart to risk losing it?</p>

			 <p><em>Building your own website isn&rsquo;t quite as easy as 1, 2, 3. But it ain&rsquo;t that much harder.</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<hr>
<p>This weekend I got the itch to customize my personal website again.</p>
<p>(Just FYI, if creating your own website sounds like a horrible idea, then check out mataroa.blog<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. You get a simple, distration-free blog with email newsletters for $9 a year. But if you instead find yourself itching for more control, then keep on reading.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d made plenty short-lived personal websites with GitHub Pages and Jekyll in the past. This time I wanted to try something different, so I decided to give Hugo a shot. The only previous experience I&rsquo;d had with Hugo came from my micro.blog<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> days. Before this weekend, I&rsquo;d never built a Hugo site from scratch.</p>
<p>I mostly followed a tutorial I found on someone else&rsquo;s blog, so this post won&rsquo;t be a step-by-step repeat of that wonderful resource. In the hope of saving you time and sparing you some headache, I&rsquo;ll instead focus on some issues left unmentioned in most tutorials for making your own site with Hugo and GitHub Pages.</p>
<h2 id="the-theme">The theme</h2>
<p>I chose the PaperMod theme because I fell in love with a fork of the Paper theme<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> on micro.blog. The theme is simple and elegant.</p>
<p><strong>A few things I love about the PaperMod theme:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Social icons</li>
<li>Dark/light theme toggle</li>
<li>Post navigation at the bottom of each post</li>
<li>Search page included</li>
<li>Tags pages automatically generated</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-tutorial">The tutorial</h2>
<p>I mostly relied on a tutorial by Chris J. Hart<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve already said, I won&rsquo;t be repeating his great tutorial. But I had some problems not addressed in his tutorial, so I&rsquo;ll cover those issues below in the addendums.</p>
<h2 id="addendums">Addendums</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some extra information I would include to any tutorial about building your own site with Hugo and GitHub Pages.</p>
<h3 id="put-a-cname-file-in-the-static-folder">Put a CNAME file in the static folder</h3>
<p>Updates caused my site to forget the custom domain (jakelacaze.com), so after an update, I had to re-enter my domain in the Settings panel of the repository for my site.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The fix ended up being to create a CNAME file (with my custom domain as its contents) inside the <code>static</code> folder.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Putting a CNAME file in the root directory didn&rsquo;t fix the issue. I can&rsquo;t say why putting the CNAME in the static folder works; I can only report the facts as far as I understand them.</p>
<h3 id="fork-the-theme-for-your-submodule">Fork the theme for your submodule</h3>
<p>The tutorial&ndash;and most others like it&ndash;recommends using your desired theme as a submodule.</p>
<p>I instead ended up forking the theme so that I could easily edit it.</p>
<p>I ran into a problem when I tried to change the theme&rsquo;s RSS feed to show full content rather than just a summary. I needed to change only one word, but to do so appeared to require a change from the original theme repository and developer. By forking the theme, you can make all the changes your heart desires, directly in your main branch<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a workaround if you don&rsquo;t fork the theme, but I couldn&rsquo;t find one. So, unless you already know the solution, I&rsquo;d recommend forking the theme in case you want to change something later.</p>
<h3 id="confusion-about-the-the-config-file-name">Confusion about the the config file name</h3>
<p>The tutorial references <code>config.toml</code> as your config file. The convention now appears to be to use <code>hugo.toml</code> instead<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have a basic <code>hugo.toml</code> file when you create your site. I changed mine to <code>hugo.yaml</code> because I was already familiar with the YAML syntax. Just something to keep in mind . . .</p>
<h2 id="see-my-repo-for-more">See my repo for more</h2>
<p>Feel free to check out the repository for my personal site<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> if you want to dig deeper into my customizations, or if you&rsquo;re interested in something I forgot to mention here.</p>

<p>Is AI the ultimate example of a solution looking for a problem? Or, to use another analogy: Is AI the ultimate hammer to which everything appears a nail?</p>
<p>When you solve most problems, you usually start with the problem itself. You identify what&rsquo;s wrong and you have an idea of how you want it to be better. You then work your way through the problem and escalate as needed.</p>
<p>In so many situations with AI, it seems like we&rsquo;re going backwards, as if we&rsquo;re saying, <em>Here&rsquo;s a powerful tool&ndash;what are some major problems it can solve?</em></p>
<p>It seems we&rsquo;re having these great advancements in AI, but we&rsquo;re not adopting or using the technology as quickly as the developers would like. It kinda feels like they&rsquo;re forcing it, like they&rsquo;re trying to squeeze it in wherever they can. In so many situations, there identifying real problems&ndash;and technology can likely help&ndash;but I&rsquo;m not sure <em>AI</em> is needed in all these situations.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m worried that we&rsquo;re going too extreme.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid that AI is capable of replacing humans. I&rsquo;m afraid that it&rsquo;s incapable of replacing humans but that certain people will try to make it replace us anyway.</p>

			 <p><em>Either a work is inspiring or insightful, or it&rsquo;s not. Stop qualifying the work by saying it was created by an LLM or another form of generative AI.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I recently made a tongue-in-cheek post on LinkedIn, directed as a jab at how some people give large language models (LLMs) too much credit simply because they&rsquo;re machines.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This silly post got me thinking about content quality vs. content source.</p>
<p>If you disagree with the point of my post, that&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;re free to criticize it, poke holes in it, and tear it apart. I ask only that you would do the same if this post were created by an LLM like ChatGPT. Please don&rsquo;t be one of those people who would think the post were insightful if written by a machine trained for countless hours on terabytes and terabytes of data. In this situation, the result is far more important than the process.</p>
<p>LLMs and other generative AI must be held to higher standards. We must stop pretending these models are smart just because they use so much data. Data alone is useless without critical thinking and insight. If the models and their algorithms are flawed, there&rsquo;s only so much the models can do with more data.</p>
<p>My own model, JakeGPT, is trained on nearly 40 years of experience as a real-world human being, including a marketing degree and 15 months in tech marketing. JakeGPT may not have been trained on the largest dataset, but at some point, data is no longer the limiting factor&ndash;so more data is not the answer.</p>
<p>Until AI can replace humans everywhere, it will be necessary to relate to humans to influence them. Data and facts and figures&ndash;the strengths of AI&ndash;can go only so far. Humans still respond to story, and personal stories are more effective than the generalizations that LLMs churn out.</p>
<p>Personal story and insights are the strengths of JakeGPT. Sure, the model is flawed and unintentionally biased in its own ways. But so are models like ChatGPT. And JakeGPT needs less data, less training, and less electricity. And perhaps best of all, JakeGPT is less likely to empower bad actors looking to deceive or harm others. (But if JakeGPT does ever go rogue, it can&rsquo;t be used for nefarious purposes at the same scale as other models.)</p>
<p>And the cherry on top: JakeGPT plays for Team Human.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

			 <p><em>The internet is full of people worrying about there being too much AI, too fast just around the corner. But what if there&rsquo;s not enough in a timely manner?</em></p>
<hr>
<p>These days, people are worried about AI taking their jobs. And who can blame them, with all the stories circulating about AI&rsquo;s great accomplishments. (P.S. If you&rsquo;re looking for a counterweight to the hype, read <em>Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust</em> by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. And subscribe to Gary Marcus&rsquo;s Substack while you&rsquo;re at it.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only natural that workers would worry about their jobs and livelihoods, when employers have a history of eliminating workers wherever they can. But employees are not the only ones who should be worried. Employers may find themselves wondering what they&rsquo;ll do when AI can&rsquo;t replace enough workers.</p>
<p>The Baby Boomers, the largest generation of all time, are retiring. Generation X and Millennials are already entrenched in the workforce while Generation Z/The Zoomers are entering the workforce. So we can basically say Gen Z is tasked with replacing the Boomers.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the big deal?</p>
<p>As Peter Zeihan is constantly reminding us, Gen Z is tiny in comparison to the Boombers<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Gen Z simply doesn&rsquo;t have enough bodies to replace the exiting Boomers. On top of that, Gen Z is highly educated and great with technology. Very few in Gen Z want&ndash;or have the skill&ndash;to replace the blue collar Boomers leaving the workforce. In the coming years, we can likely expect a shortage of workers in fields like plumbing, carpentry, and truck driving.</p>
<p>Workers would be foolish not to exploit their leverage into better wages, benefits, and conditions for themselves. Despite what the prophets of AI may claim, AI is not ready to replace these missing workers.</p>
<p>In America (and much of the West), we&rsquo;ve built our economy around cheap labor. This strategy made sense when we had the population to support it. And if there wasn&rsquo;t someone here willing to do the job, you could bet there was someone on just the other side of the border eager to take on the task. But what does our world look like when you can&rsquo;t count on imported labor when other populations are experiencing a similar decline, but at a faster rate?</p>
<p>The anti-immigration crowd really won&rsquo;t have a leg to stand on. As David Frum has pointed out, the question isn&rsquo;t whether we should allow immigration. The question is, How much?<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The follow-up question is, What kind of immigration should be allowed?</p>
<p>If, for whatever reason we&rsquo;re worried about not having enough workers in the future, it sure would be nice if AI could help out a bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take this chance to echo a point I&rsquo;ve made on other platforms: I&rsquo;m not concerned that AI is ready to replace humans; I&rsquo;m concerned that it isn&rsquo;t ready but people will try to make it happen anyway. Some will try to make it happen because they&rsquo;re excited by the hype. Some will make it happen because they don&rsquo;t want to pay workers. And at some point, some will make it happen because they&rsquo;re having trouble finding anyone with the proper skills to hire.</p>
<p>It would actually help if AI were as capable as its prophets insist. AI could help fill the labor gap and save a lot of people a lot of pain. So maybe we&rsquo;ve been looking at this AI issue all wrong.</p>
<p>If only AI really were up for the tasks as has been promised, maybe then we&rsquo;d be in for less headache in the years ahead.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><em>For the last few years, the oil and gas sector has been waiting to be reshaped through mergers and acquisitions. Is ExxonMobil&rsquo;s latest move a sign of the prophecy?</em></p>
<hr>
<p>ExxonMobil recently shocked the energy industry with its nearly $60 billion bid to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources in an all-stock deal<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. When the deal closes, one of the world&rsquo;s supermajors will have the acreage and production runway of the Permian Basin&rsquo;s top driller. ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods justified the deal simply<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their [Pioneer’s] capabilities, bringing in their Tier 1 acreage, our technology, our development approach, frankly, brings higher recovery at lower cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find plenty articles discussing the financial sense of this deal&ndash;and by all appearances, the deal makes plenty financial sense. But, as a hopeless writer, I can&rsquo;t help looking at the acquisition from a storyteller&rsquo;s lens.</p>
<p>Energy analysts have been predicting a wave of mergers of acquisitions (M&amp;A) for a while now. The long-awaited prophecy appears to finally be coming true with the news of Exxon&rsquo;s pending acquisition of Pioneer.</p>
<p>The early 2000s saw American exploration and production (E&amp;P) activity dominated by the independent producers, as the majors decided to take their money international<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. When those overseas ventures failed, the majors struggled to establish a foothold in America&rsquo;s onshore plays. I was lucky to have started my oil and gas career during this independent-dominated phase, when even a marginally capable and reliable warm body could quickly climb the ranks. (A note for the young: Scott Galloway is right when he says it&rsquo;s better to be mediocre in a booming field than to be outstanding in a mediocre field. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t find the article/video in which he said this, but trust me on this one&ndash;he totes did.)</p>
<p>Many of the land professionals of my generation started their careers working with land services brokers in North Texas' Barnett Shale, most likely running title and leasing for Chesapeake Energy. Under CEO Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake sought to acquire as much acreage as possible, as fast as possible&ndash;costs and fiscal responsibility be damned. When natural gas prices fell from $14/MCF to sub-$3 and oil climbed to over $100 a barrel, the long-written off Permian Basin with its stacks and stacks of oil-producing formations became the industry darling<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. The great land grab eventually led to chants of &lsquo;Drill, baby, drill!&rsquo; as operators sought to prove up their assets. Mineral and royalty buyers sought to seize on this activity by buying in areas most likely to be drilled in the near future, ensuring they&rsquo;d make their money back fast.</p>
<p>In the age of the independents, opportunities abound for money. But what about now, as we&rsquo;re heading into the age of the majors? What happens to the industry as the majors spend money to make haves of the have-nots, to ensure the big only get bigger?</p>
<p>If Exxon really is kicking off the Great Consolidation, then we can expect to see less drilling in general. We haven&rsquo;t seen significant sustained exploration of new fields for at least a decade. With reduced drilling, the mineral and royalty buyers will need to alter their business models.</p>
<p>Oil and gas is likely entering a less exciting but more stable era&ndash;an era far different from the one that let me start and develop my career. So I lean into this new era with melancholy as I accept that I&rsquo;m getting old and the world around me is changing. I&rsquo;m wise enough to know this new era won&rsquo;t last forever. But I&rsquo;m not smart enough to know how or when it will change, or what will change it.</p>
<p>In the late &rsquo;80s and the &rsquo;90s, conventional wisdom said the Permian Basin was dead. But conventional wisdom got bucked by unconventional drilling thanks to the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (fracking)<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Technology may very well again transform the industry, but who knows what those technological innovations will look like, or when they&rsquo;ll happen. Fracking was discovered out of desperation and experimentation, not because of scientific theory that suggested the process would increase production<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Maybe the next great innovation will happen because someone somewhere says <em>Hell, what have I got to lose?</em> and tries something stupid that ends up looking genius in the end.</p>
<p>The industry may also change due to economics. If oil and gas prices go through the roof, fields once deemed uneconomic to drill will then make sense. The Permian Basin will still be the apple of the industry&rsquo;s eye, but at least there will be more fields to play in and explore.</p>
<p>Yes, Exxon&rsquo;s acquisition of Pioneer likely signals a shift in the industry. Since the news broke, word has leaked that Chesapeake is mulling acquiring Southwestern Energy<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. And Devon Energy is also mulling acquiring Marathon Oil Corp. or CrownRock, the latter of which recently announced it was open to being acquired<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One thing is certain: This era too shall pass. But what it shall pass to, we do not know.</p>

			 <p><em>Technology doesn&rsquo;t progress on its own simply because we expect it to.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>On a recent episode of Andrew Yang&rsquo;s <em>Forward</em> podcast<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, Walter Isaacson shared an anecdote he picked up while shadowing Elon Musk for the entrepreneur&rsquo;s recently-released eponymous biography<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. In this anecdote, Musk made the point that people take for granted that technology progresses on its own, as if it&rsquo;s an unwritten law of the universe. As if things just move forward with time.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to get Musk&rsquo;s point out of my head after first hearing it. Why? What&rsquo;s so significant about it? What does it really mean?</p>
<p>To me, it means humans have agency in shaping their future. More importantly, humans have a <em>responsibility</em> in shaping that future.</p>
<p>Too many of us accept that things will just work out. Or that they won&rsquo;t. Whatever our outlook, we get complacent. We take whatever we can get. We accept the future and consequences we&rsquo;re dealt. We blame the dealer even though we never acted on our chance to cut the deck.</p>
<p>Technology is not some mysterious force. There is no invisible hand of technology moving it in one direction or the other. Technology is the byproduct of our creations and the norms we create around using those creations.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, AI is all the rage. I don&rsquo;t think AI is worthy of being injected into every aspect of our lives, but unfortunately, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it <em>won&rsquo;t</em> be injected into every area and situation possible. But this strategy is unforgivably reckless, because, as John Oliver said in his bit about AI on <em>Last Week Tonight</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with AI isn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s smart&ndash;it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s stupid in ways we can&rsquo;t always predict.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On his Substack, Gary Marcus recently echoed this sentiment when he pointed out how DALL-E 3<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, the latest version of OpenAI&rsquo;s image generator, had problems showing black doctors with white patients, or a watch showing the time of 1 o&rsquo;clock.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> We still don&rsquo;t know the ways in which AI has unintentional bias. And we do a disservice by presenting AI as being limitlessly intelligent, when in fact its capabilities very much depend on <em>how</em> it&rsquo;s trained and <em>what</em> it&rsquo;s trained <em>on</em>.</p>
<p>At the risk of becoming a broken record, I&rsquo;ll say it again: AI has potential. We should explore where and how it can help humanity. But we must do so in a responsible manner. We must be thoughtful and deliberate. Right now, we&rsquo;re being anything but.</p>
<p>Technology doesn&rsquo;t simply advance <em>just because</em>. It moves along the path we create for it. And I hope more people will start chiming in on which path we set this risky technology on. Just because there are risks involved doesn&rsquo;t mean there aren&rsquo;t great benefits waiting. But again, those benefits won&rsquo;t happen on their own. We must play our part in making those benefits reality.</p>

			 <p><em>Can we be mindful in the 21st century?</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Introverts make up at least one-third of the population—maybe as high as one-half—yet in so many ways the world feels as if it&rsquo;s made only for extroverts. How can it be that our social systems benefit one type of person while alienating the other?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Pop culture often presents the introvert as being inadequate and odd, a type of person to be fixed or merely tolerated when possible. Introverts are often described as antisocial, but it would be more accurate to say introverts have a different threshold for social interaction. I, as an introvert, recognized this distinction during the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, I thought I&rsquo;d be fine in isolation. But forced social distancing revealed that I craved interaction. Interaction itself wasn&rsquo;t the issue—the quality and frequency of interaction were the real questions.</p>
<p>And those questions of quality and frequency have led to my questioning online interactions, mostly via social media. This extroverted world expects us to be everywhere online at all times. Digital tools are available to help us scale, to be present at many places at once. But operating this way leads to the problems of the quality and the frequency of conversation. We&rsquo;re told to keep the conversation going so that the algorithms favor us and push our content to more viewers in the name of promoting the conversation—conversation we may not even want to be part of.</p>
<p>In her book <em>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&rsquo;t Stop Talking</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, Susan Cain argues that introverts need seclusion to recover after interactions. Introverts tend to perceive more than extroverts, Cain says, so introverts have more to sort through after social situations. This always &lsquo;ON&rsquo; world of social media means introverts have an endless wave of interactions to process, all of this in addition to their offline interactions.</p>
<p>But what about the physical world, the one we live in without the need for screens? Where&rsquo;s the concern about making sure we&rsquo;re present there, and that we can process all happening around us? How can any anyone hope to process anything when new events are constantly dinging for our attention? We&rsquo;re constantly connected to the world at all times. But why? Do we want to be? Should we want to be?</p>
<p>Questions like these are the ones that have been floating in my head since I started reading <em>Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> by Douglas Rushkoff. What exactly does &lsquo;present&rsquo; mean? What is the true present moment? The tangible present, or the virtual present?</p>
<p>Are these questions as concerning for extroverts? Or, do they feel the more <em>presents</em>, the better? If you see an issue, you must then consider the costs, both the costs of being so present and also the cost of not being present. You must find your own balance and determine when and where you want to be present—or have the energy to do so. Some will try to convince you that you must be everywhere. But if you&rsquo;re everywhere, are you really ever anywhere? This is the same question I ask of those hoping to scale their presence with the help of AI. Doesn&rsquo;t being everywhere in such fashion cheapen the worth of your time and presence? Isn&rsquo;t your scarce availability the true value of your presence? Is there any added value in our <em>truly</em> being present? Will anyone know the difference?</p>
<p>The promise of &lsquo;community&rsquo; is supposed to be part of the appeal of social media and the modern web. But so many digital platforms seek to be a one-size-fits-all solution for the masses. &lsquo;Community&rsquo; and &lsquo;masses&rsquo; are often conflicting terms. How often can we have community if we invite the masses? To be noticed on these platforms often requires appeasing to the masses while ignoring your potential true audience, meaning the masses then distract from the true community.</p>
<p>Our presence is more than a simple commodity. Or is it?</p>
<p>By embracing digital extroversion, not only are we giving away our attention and our presence—we&rsquo;re also giving away data, which recently may have been used to train generative AI models we now fear may take our jobs<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Living as an extrovert introduces noise, both literal and figurative, into your life, which is fine if you’re up for it. But the extroverted web doesn’t want you to slip away to recover and rejoin when you’re ready. The extroverted web says you’re missing out on the endless firehouse of content that will be outdated and irrelevant by the time you learn about it. You’re also missing out on exposure, as the most crucial part of the online growth formula seems to be consistency, meaning you must constantly churn out content so that your audience doesn’t forget you.</p>
<p>These days, there’s far too much content to stay current on. And what kind of audience do you have—and what’s your relationship with them—if the volume of your output is exponentially more valuable than the quality of your output?</p>
<p>The tech giants have built their platforms on our content. They&rsquo;ve simply given us a place to connect, but we do the hard work of creating content that keeps eyeballs on the page or on the app. No wonder the tech giants love the extroverted model.</p>
<p>Eventually, digital extroversion turns into neediness, in the form the need to be liked and accepted, to increase the chances of being watched. A need to be interesting without offending, for fear of having your content demonetized or shadowbanned. This neediness risks becoming a need to fit in, to be like everyone else online—an NPC<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> in a vast sea of unimaginative homogenization where imitation is often the safest path to success.</p>
<p>For some, this formula may not be a problem, especially if the main goal is to be popular. But the rest of us likely find ourselves sucked into this way of thinking because it&rsquo;s so prevalent—we don&rsquo;t even realize we&rsquo;re influenced by it. So we end up chasing a goal we may not even want. We no longer create only for the sake of it. We create for likes and views and follows, making the internet far less interesting and dynamic.</p>
<p>Offline, introverts often get out of their shells to put themselves out there and meet the world halfway. But to have meaningful sustained discourse with introverts often requires pursuing them to some degree. Maybe this is how it should be online as well. Offline, we have the option to go to so many parties that we never attend. Maybe this is how it should be online too. We can try the parties every once in a while when we feel up to it, but the rest of the time you can find us at our websites and email addresses. Reaching us may take a little effort on your end, but hopefully it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

			 <p><em>What does convenience cost us in the long run?</em></p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/jake-lacaze">Listen on Anchor</a></p>
<p>As long as there are people, there will be questions about the human condition. How are people doing? What are their greatest struggles and fears and joys? And what does it mean to be a real human being<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> at any point in time?</p>
<p>Odds are good I won&rsquo;t make it out of the 21st century alive. So considering what it means to be human in the 21st century seems a good place to put my energy for the next version of my blog.</p>
<p>In so many ways, life has never been better for those of us in the first world. We&rsquo;ve spent most of our lives in unprecedented safety and convenience, thanks at least in part to technology. But, strange as it may sound, might that same convenience bring about our greatest challenges? The world is at our fingertips thanks to smart phones and other mobile devices. But having these remedies to boredom always at arm&rsquo;s length makes it hard to be present in the real world beyond the screens. We must also fight the temptation to live always in a digital world when tech titans are always telling us what a great option it is. And don&rsquo;t forget that these same titans have engineered their products and services to be addictive to keep us coming back. As they keep us addicted, they&rsquo;re harvesting our data and doing who knows what with it. We now know they&rsquo;re using that same data to train AI with the hope of replacing us. Many businesses will adopt these AI &lsquo;solutions&rsquo; haphazardly, putting humans at risk in the name of efficiency.</p>
<p>I grew up enamored with technology, believing it could make life better. I still believe it <em>can</em>, with some caveats. Inserting technology into a process or situation doesn&rsquo;t guarantee success. And it&rsquo;s hard to do the right way. Drumming up hype and excitement is easy, but those same elements make it hard to know if the technology is actually useful, or useful to the extent promised.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve reached a point where we need to put this convenience into perspective. Has it really been all that great? Has it served us as users? Even if everything was great in the past, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to go along for the ride in the future. Maybe some people feel the past cost of convenience was fine, but they&rsquo;re not so sure about the costs of what&rsquo;s ahead. Or, maybe we don&rsquo;t have a choice. Maybe certain things are set in motion, meaning the future is already determined and there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it. To be clear, I don&rsquo;t hold this view, but if you do, I hope you&rsquo;ll agree we should consider what lies ahead as we can best prepare ourselves.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend to have a crystal ball that shows the future. While I ponder our future, I&rsquo;m no futurist. I prefer to discuss how things <em>can</em> go rather than how they <em>will</em> go. So while I don&rsquo;t have predictions of the future, I do have concerns and hopes. I&rsquo;m concerned that certain advances in technology seek to make humans irrelevant<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. But I hope we can find our way to maintain&ndash;and improve&ndash;our humanity.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be human in the 21st century? What are our best parts that should be amplified? And which parts should be improved upon? These are fair questions, and there are so many similar questions deserving consideration. So I hope you&rsquo;ll join me as I do my best to do them justice.</p>

			 <p>The more I learn about nuclear, the more I become convinced it&rsquo;s the key to solving our energy woes. And Michael Shellenberger&rsquo;s <em>Apocalypse Never</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> may have pushed me over the edge.</p>
<p><img src="https://jakelacaze.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e48f33b44c.jpg" alt="Cover of Michael Shellenberger&rsquo;s Apocalypse Never">
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cover of Michael Shellenberger&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apocalypse Never<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>Why are environmentalists so strongly opposed to nuclear energy? Nuclear is abundant, clean, and energy dense. Yet so-called environmentalists (or, perhaps more appropriately, environmental alarmists) keep pushing for solar and wind, which are proven to be inefficient and terrible for the environment in their own ways.</p>
<h2 id="the-dangers-of-environmental-alarmism">The dangers of environmental alarmism</h2>
<p><em>Apocalypse Never</em> is not a book about climate change denialism. Shellenberger believes in climate change and also believes humans play a role.</p>
<p>But he argues climate change is not the same as climate catastrophe, and environmental alarmism does more harm than good.</p>
<p>Shellenberger&rsquo;s case has merit when you look into some details of environmental alarmism.</p>
<p>For one, enviornmental alarmists don&rsquo;t look at how we can adapt to climate change. They instead repeat the narrative that it&rsquo;s too late and that climate change can&rsquo;t be stopped. While climate change may unstoppable, it&rsquo;s not necessarily catastrophic. And if it&rsquo;s inevitable, then we should learn to live with the coming changes, which is far more productive than waving our hands in the air and declaring the end. Humans are adaptive and resilient. The sooner we start changing with the times, the better.</p>
<p>Another aspect to consider is the hypocrisy of developed nations pushing developing nations to &ldquo;leapfrog&rdquo; straight to renewable energy while bypassing fossil fuels. Never mind the fact that sources of renewable energy such as solar and wind are expensive and not as efficient as fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Rather than focus on holding back the developing nations, those already developed should consider how to responsibly help them progress. Developed nations should lean into alternative fuels where it makes sense, while helping developing nations improve their infrastructure with fossil fuels and then accelerate into alternative fuels. Restricting developing nations from improving their own infrastructure hurts the citizens of those nations. It&rsquo;s easy for the developed nations to push this agenda when they themselves are not affected by the policies they promote.</p>
<p>The public narrative suggests that fans of renewable energy see the agents of fossil fuels as their enemy. But Shellenberger raises the possibility that these two industries instead have a shared enemy in nuclear energy.</p>
<p>Shellenberger shows example after example of environmental groups and individual advocates (such as Sierra Club and Al Gore) accepting money from fossil fuel companies, which feels like a stark contradiction to their ideology.</p>
<p>But, when you look for the similarities between fossil fuel companies and renewable energy companies, you find a shared hatred of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>Shellenberger then asks the logical question: &ldquo;[H]ow long, exactly, have oil and gas interests been funding environmental groups to shut down nuclear plants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If nuclear is as good as advertised, then how much need would there be for other forms of energy?</p>
<p>Much of the opposition to nuclear energy is simply out of line.</p>
<p>Some point to Chernobyl as a warning. But Chernobyl was more an issue of Soviet neglect than an issue of nuclear power<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But what about Fukushima? Turns out neglect was an issue there as well<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tsunami countermeasures taken when Fukushima Daiichi was designed and sited in the 1960s were considered acceptable in relation to the scientific knowledge then, with low recorded run-up heights for that particular coastline. But some 18 years before the 2011 disaster, new scientific knowledge had emerged about the likelihood of a large earthquake and resulting major tsunami of some 15.7 metres at the Daiichi site. However, this had not yet led to any major action by either the plant operator, Tepco, or government regulators, notably the Nuclear &amp; Industrial Safety Agency (NISA). Discussion was ongoing, but action minimal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This negligence rhymes a bit with the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans, which we now know was made worse by <a href="https://www.history.com/news/hurricane-katrina-levee-failures">faulty levees</a> neglected despite warnings they were inadequate for a major storm.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, humans could have done more to lessen the damage of these disasters. But many choose to scapegoat the disasters themselves rather than look at what we could have done better. Such negligence will only be perpetuated by the narrative that it&rsquo;s too late and that there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about our impending doom.</p>
<p>Shellnberger argues that ideology is to blame and calls environmental alarmism the new secular religion.</p>
<p>Many have already accepted our climate apocalypse, so they look only for validation while rejecting the idea of improving our situation. Religious zealots often quote their religious tomes when referencing modern events as proof of the coming Armageddon. Environmental alarmists do much the same, except they quote choice books of science.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve accepted an outcome, you default to validating it, rather than remaining open to the possibility you may be wrong. So the enviromental alarmists reject any data contradicting their gloomy predictions.</p>
<h2 id="how-green-is-renewable-energy-really">How green is renewable energy really?</h2>
<p>When you scratch beneath the surface, you start to see <strong>issues with the renewable energy narrative</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>How green are electric vehicles (EVs) if they&rsquo;re getting electricity from fossil fuels<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>?</li>
<li>How are the materials used for EVs, solar panels, and windmills mined, manufactured, and installed? (Most likely with the aid of fossil fuels and at great damage to their enviornments<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.)</li>
<li>How can we say energy sources such as solar and wind are environmentally friendly when they&rsquo;re far less energy dense than fossil fuels and require much more land surface area<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>? (Also, windmills are loud and disrupt bird habitats.)</li>
<li>How can we call solar and wind green when recycling solar panels and windmills is an absolute nightmare? (We don&rsquo;t have the ability or capacity to recycle these parts, so they create more waste when they&rsquo;re retired<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.)</li>
</ol>
<p>To be clear, these points do not suggest that fossil fuels are a net zero fuel source. But they do suggest that &ldquo;green&rdquo; energy may not be too much better in comparison when considering the whole picture.</p>
<h2 id="why-nuclear-is-the-answer">Why nuclear is the answer</h2>
<p>As the Office of Nuclear Energy points outs<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, there are three reasons <strong>nuclear energy is the way to go</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nuclear is a zero-emission clean energy source.</li>
<li>Nuclear energy produces more electricity on less land than any other clean-air source. (It&rsquo;s energy dense.)</li>
<li>Nuclear energy produces minimal waste.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other forms of renewable energy such as solar and wind likely have a place in the world&rsquo;s future energy portfolio. But they don&rsquo;t deserve to be the star of the show. That honor belongs to nuclear.</p>
<p>But even if we universally agreed to adopt more nuclear energy, we can&rsquo;t just flick a switch and make it happen.</p>
<p>Bringing a new nuclear facility online takes years, sometimes nearly a decade<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. So we can&rsquo;t solve our energy woes in the 2020s.</p>
<p>But you know the old saying: The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today.</p>
<p>The delayed payoff is no reason to abandon building new nuclear plants. Investing in nuclear is an investment in our energy future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we should continue relying on fossil fuels to keep the world moving until we can hand the torch to nuclear.</p>

			 <p>In November of last year I wanted a convenient way to carry my jounral, pens, and Kindle together. These items easily fit into my <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/targus-octave-ii-backpack-for-15-6-laptops-black/6502673.p?skuId=6502673">backpack</a> I use for my day job. But sometimes I don&rsquo;t want to carry my laptop and chargers and everything else I usually carry to and from the office.</p>
<p>I wanted something that would make it easy to keep my writerly items together so I could easily remove them from my backpack in one motion.</p>
<p>So I took advantage of a Black Friday deal and bought the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/diodrio-Moleskine-LEUCHTTURM-Sketchbook-Refillable/dp/B0BBQSY7Y5/ref=sr_1_3?crid=19R103S80YGZ1&amp;keywords=diodrio+a5&amp;qid=1675027739&amp;sprefix=diodrio+a5%2Caps%2C136&amp;sr=8-3">diodrio A5 zipper journal cover</a>.</p>

<p>This cover isn&rsquo;t a necessity. But it packs a lot of convenience for what I paid for it: less than $11.</p>

</ul>
<p>🗒️ <strong>Note:</strong> This item was listed at $11.99 on January 29, 2023. So it may be on sale, depending on when you&rsquo;re reading this review.</p>
<h2 id="use-and-experience">Use and experience</h2>
<p>This cover works as expected. And at a great price.</p>
<p>The cover has plenty space to hold a thick A5 journal. Mine is holding an <a href="https://www.dromgooles.com/sakae-tp-68-gsm-tomoe-river-paper-368-page-plain.html">A5 journal from SAKAEtp</a>, with 368 pages of 68gsm Tomoe River paper. Whether the cover can hold your journal of choice will also depend on what else you hold inside the cover.</p>
<p>The inside of my cover holds a journal and my Kindle Oasis.</p>
<p>And my front pocket holds a few pens and a mechanical pencil.</p>
<p>One of the front pockets can hold an iPhone 7 without a case. (Do what you will with that information.)</p>
<p>Because the cover can hold an A5 notebook or notepad, you can use one of the slots for extra storage. Maybe for a few sticky notes.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>Photo courtesy of Amazon product listing</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The product listing boasts that the cover includes a strap for easy carrying. But it adds little to no value for me. I prefer to hold and carry the cover like a large hardcover book.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-diodrio-a5-zipper-journal-cover-worth-it">Is the diodrio A5 zipper journal cover worth it?</h2>
<p>For the price I paid—$10.99 plus tax—the answer is YES.</p>
<p>Is it worth the list price of $22.99? That question is harder to answer because I didn&rsquo;t pay full price.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m again leaning toward yes.</p>
<p>This cover includes a lot of storage options in a neat, tiny package.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t yet speak to the cover&rsquo;s long-term durability. But it&rsquo;s held up well in my first couple months of use. I haven&rsquo;t tried to destroy the cover. But I also haven&rsquo;t been the gentlest with it due to its low price.</p>
<p>This cheap cover has scratched itches I&rsquo;ve had for more expensive covers such as the <a href="https://www.galenleather.com/collections/zippered-leather-portfolio/zip-a5">zip folios from Galen Leather</a> for $119.</p>
<p>There are certainly nicer (and more expensive) covers out there. But it&rsquo;s hard to imagine many more practical than the diodrio A5 zipper  journal cover on sale.</p>

			 <p>Let&rsquo;s kill title case once and for all. Except for in one specific situation—when writing titles.</p>
<p>But for everything else, kill title case and use sentence case instead.</p>
<p>Title case has no place in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog headings</li>
<li>UX/UI</li>
<li>Calls to action (CTAs)</li>
<li>Sentences</li>
</ul>
<p>Title case is a pain to read.</p>
<p>Switching between capital and lowercase letters makes readers uneasy. Too many capital letters make reading confusing. Readers ask themselves if the capitalized words are proper nouns or important words. Title case makes readers think too much. And that&rsquo;s a no-no. (Steve Krug wrote a whole book about why that&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515">a bad idea</a>.)</p>
<p>While ALL CAPS may come across as rude, they&rsquo;re actually more considerate because at least they&rsquo;re consistent.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re writing a title, capitalize only the first letter and then any proper nouns that follow.</p>
<p>Just say no to title case. Choose sentence case.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be real: Your readers likely won&rsquo;t thank you for using sentence case over title case. But your writing will be easier to read.</p>
<p>And, really, ain&rsquo;t that what this whole writing thing is all about?</p>

			 <p>The Pilot Metropolitan tops most lists of starter fountain pens.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan is a good pen. But it&rsquo;s not even the best starter fountain pen within its own brand. That honor belongs to the Pilot Kakuno. That&rsquo;s like naming a college football team #1 in the country when they didn&rsquo;t even win their conference. I mean, it happens—but it doesn&rsquo;t feel right.</p>

<p>The Pilot Kakuno has some features (or lack of) that may make it less desirable than the Metropolitan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of clip on cap <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
(But the cap includes a small tab to prevent rolling on surfaces.)</li>
<li>Plastic body and lighter weight compared to the Metropolitan</li>
<li>Smiley face on the nib <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
(Or this may be a feature, depending on your tastes. I&rsquo;m not a fan.)</li>

<h2 id="the-pilot-metropolitan-is-not-worth-double-the-price-of-the-kakuno">The Pilot Metropolitan is not worth double the price of the Kakuno</h2>
<p>You can argue the Metropolitan is a better pen than the Kakuno. For one, the Metropolitan includes a clip on its cap, which the Kakuno lacks. And some users prefer the metal body and heavier weight of the Metropolitan. (I myself am not bothered by the plastic body of the Kakuno. And I love how light it is in comparison to the Metropolitan.)</p>
<p>But the Metropolitan is not worth nearly twice the price of the Kakuno as <em>a starter pen for the masses</em>.</p>
<p>The nib is what makes Pilot pens so great. And with the Kakuno, you get the Pilot nib so many pen hobbyists know and love, at around half the price of the Metropolitan.</p>
<p>Both the Kakuno and the Metropolitan come with ink cartridges. So both requiring buying a converter if you prefer converters over cartridges.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan may be a better pen for some people. But the Kakuno is the better choice for broad recommendations—like any list about the top starter fountain pens.</p>

			 <p>Writing is easy. All you do is string together a bunch of words.</p>
<p>Or so some would have you think. Never mind the fact that so many of us are terrible at saying what we mean.</p>
<p>Writing is much harder than some give credit.</p>
<p>Because writing is more than words.</p>
<h2 id="writing-is-research">Writing is research</h2>
<p>Finding the right words is much harder when you don&rsquo;t know <em>what</em> you want to say.</p>
<p>The words flow more easily if you&rsquo;ve researched your topic. If you&rsquo;ve read up and immersed yourself in related matters. If you&rsquo;ve taken notes in your own words.</p>
<p>You gotta make deposits before you make withdrawals. And in writing, those deposits come in the form or research.</p>
<h2 id="writing-is-empathy">Writing is empathy</h2>
<p>Readers are more likely to remember writing that speaks to them. That speaks to their struggles and fears. That speaks to where they&rsquo;ve been, where they are, and where hoping to end up.</p>
<p>Writing is more powerful when it comes from a writer who is <em>human</em>. Someone with empathy.</p>
<p>🗒️ <strong>Note:</strong> The advantage of empathy is one of many reasons <a href="/blog/chatgpt-writes-500-words-about-why-artificial-intelligence-will-never-replace-humans/">AI writers like ChatGPT won&rsquo;t replace quality content writers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="writing-is-visual">Writing is visual</h2>
<p>Most writers don&rsquo;t think of themselves as visual artists. But the visual aspects of writing still matter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason we break our text into paragraphs or lines rather than crapping our words into one big block.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason bloggers use headers in their posts to join related sentences.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a reason we should <a href="/2023/01/29/the-case-against.html">use title case only when absolutely necessary</a>.</p>
<p>The reason? Writing is visual.</p>
<p>So, the next someone asks why you&rsquo;re making such a big deal about writing. That it&rsquo;s just the act of putting a bunch of words together, one after the other. Just send them this post and tell them to STFU.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jakelacaze.com/2023/01/10/social-media-engagement.html">Social media engagement algorithms and the illusion of choice</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>So many of us, over the last couple years, have been rethinking our relationship with social media and the internet at large.</p>
<p>My own wonderings about technology have seen me dabbling into using only open source operating systems and software. But I&rsquo;ve recently realized that while I appreciate open source and like the idea of all technology being open source, I am not an open source purist or absolutist. Like so many digital citizens, I have concerns about privacy and security. But in these areas, again, I am not a purist.</p>
<p>If I feel this way about technology at large, it only makes sense that I have similar concerns about social media. And I imagine I&rsquo;m not alone.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m correct, then it makes sense to ask:</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-problem-with-social-media">What&rsquo;s the problem with social media?</h2>
<p>Social media used to be a way to stay in touch with friends and family and random weirdos you found in various corners of the internet. But now it feels like this thing we do out of habit, even though it drives us crazy.</p>
<p>The problem with social media overwhelmingly seems to be the engagement algorithms. The efforts to keep us coming back for more to boost ad revenue, even if that increased engagement results in angrier users.</p>
<h2 id="whats-so-bad-about-social-media-engagement-algorithms">What&rsquo;s so bad about social media engagement algorithms?</h2>
<p>Angry users—a side effect of these engagement algorithms—is definitely a problem. But I think there&rsquo;s another factor that doesn&rsquo;t get enough attention: These engagement algorithms lead to an illusion of choice.</p>
<p>Users put effort into finding and following relevant and interesting voices, only to have another factor—the abstract yet opaque engagement algorithms—determine their experience on a social network.</p>
<p>When we don&rsquo;t know how these algorithms work—or <em>when</em> they&rsquo;re working—how can we be confident in our ability to build or curate own digital experience? Where is the line between being responsible for our own experience and being manipulated by mysterious forces we&rsquo;re ill-equipped to fight?</p>
<p>As <a href="https://calnewport.com">Cal Newport</a> has pointed out, social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram built their services through network effects. People joined these sites to connect with others they knew or were interested in. And the fact everyone they knew was already on these established sites was enough to keep them there. Leaving behind your connections and starting over was too costly.</p>
<p>But these social media giants gave up the advantage of network effects when they started using engagement algorithms. They threw away the main reason people used their services.
And in so many ways, the move from network effects to engagement algorithms felt like a bait and switch.</p>
<h2 id="why-arent-engagement-algorithms-on-tiktok-a-problem">Why aren&rsquo;t engagement algorithms on TikTok a problem?</h2>
<p>While concerns about security and privacy on TikTok <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/tiktok-fires-4-employees-who-used-internal-data-to-spy-on-journalists/">appear valid</a>, this post will ignore, but not <em>discount</em>, those concerns to stay on one point.</p>
<p>While users may have concerns about the types of content the TikTok algorithms serve, most users are not bothered by the presence of algorithms themselves on the service. Unlike the case with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, engagement algorithms are part of the appeal of TikTok. On TikTok, the algorithms are a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>TikTok can get by with using algorithms because TikTok doesn&rsquo;t give users the illusion of control. TikTok doesn&rsquo;t pretend to deliver content based on whom you follow. It&rsquo;s common knowledge that TikTok&rsquo;s engagement algorithms, aided with data from your views, likes, comments, and shares, decide what you see in your main feed. You have to choose the Following feed for the hope of seeing content from those you follow. So while keeping up with those you follow is an option, it is not the default. TikTok is made for finding engaging content, not for keeping up with those you already know. TikTok <em>kind of</em> gives you the option to follow individuals, but it doesn&rsquo;t put much effort into that angle.</p>
<p>While TikTok may be worthy of criticisms in some areas, the service deserves credit in terms of algorithms. While parent company ByteDance may not be transparent about how TikTok&rsquo;s engagement algorithms work, it has at least been transparent in the fact TikTok operates through engagement algorithms.</p>
<p>Users are aware of the presence of algorithms when they sign up for TikTok. They know what they&rsquo;re getting into. And they&rsquo;re mostly fine with that because they&rsquo;re not signing up to keep in touch with friends and family as they did on other sites.</p>
<h2 id="can-social-networks-have-any-value-once-engagement-algorithms-are-present">Can social networks have any value once engagement algorithms are present?</h2>
<p>The network effect seems to persist only as long as social media services steer clear of engagement algorithms. A couple such examples include <a href="https://mastodon.social">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>.</p>
<p>Networks on LinkedIn once had value because the connections were likely to be genuine, in that you either knew the person you connected to, or you had an interest in that person. But now, many connections are made only for the intent of increasing who sees a member&rsquo;s content, AKA <em>engagement</em>.</p>
<p>And once users figure what gets engagement, it&rsquo;s only natural that many would start creating content in the tried-and-true formula. So users see the same types of content over and over. Originality exists on these platforms. But it goes unseen, unrecognized, unappreciated. And so mainstream social media becomes the digital suburbs, full of cookie cutter houses lined with the same bushes and political signs.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-answer-to-social-media-engagement-algorithms">What&rsquo;s the answer to social media engagement algorithms?</h2>
<p>While <a href="/blog/the-simple-math-of-web3">web3 promises to solve all our digital woes</a>, I find the solution to be a simple and old technology: <strong>RSS</strong>.</p>
<p>Watch the video below if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with the wonders of RSS:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>🗒️ <strong>Note:</strong> This video is 15 years old, so it doesn&rsquo;t address that Google Reader is now dead. At only $15 a year, <a href="https://miniflux.app">Miniflux</a> a great alternative. Or check out <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder 5</a> or <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> if you&rsquo;re on Mac/iOS/iPad OS.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-rss-fix-the-illusion-of-control">How does RSS fix the illusion of control?</h2>
<p>RSS is the obvious choice for one simple reason: It doesn&rsquo;t give the <em>illusion</em> of control—it instead gives actual control.</p>
<p>With RSS, you decide what to subscribe to. You decide what&rsquo;s important to you. You decide what you pay attention to.</p>
<p>You are once again responsible for your online experience.</p>
<p>Sure, curating your experience takes a little more effort than relying on social media engagement algorithms. But it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The end of the year is a great time to look at what lies ahead. Because I prefer asking important questions over making bold predictions, I&rsquo;ve lately been wondering: What will digital marketing on a post-Web2 internet look like?</p>
<p>When people think of Web3, they likely think of the blockchain and crypto and other related technologies. <a href="/blog/the-simple-math-of-web3">I&rsquo;m not so sure that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed.</a> But maybe those details aren&rsquo;t so important.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-digital-marketing-on-web2-mean">What did digital marketing on Web2 mean?</h2>
<p>When I think of digital marketing on Web2, I think of easy metrics.</p>
<p>Google was free to collect and report seemingly endless data points via Google Analytics and other platforms. Siloing social media into a few major platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter made reaching the masses easier than in the early days of Web1.</p>
<p>It was easy to know where to find your customers. And it was easy to collect data and create reports to see if your marketing efforts are paying off.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, those days seem to be coming to an end.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-marketing-on-web3-look-like">What will marketing on Web3 look like?</h2>
<p>As data collection practices improve by legislation and other platforms lose their appeal as users tire of engagement algorithms and senseless internet drama, the web seems destined to fragment more in the coming years.</p>
<p>Metrics and data will still be crucial going forward. But what metrics and data will we focus on as the landscape changes and information we once took for granted is now harder to come by?</p>
<p>How will we define success if we&rsquo;re getting fewer results from more channels?</p>
<p>Will fragmentation require businesses to be more thoughtful in their marketing? To invest more in building more genuine communities? Might sites like reddit become more important in the future of digital marketing?</p>
<h2 id="the-original-hope-of-the-web">The original hope of the web</h2>
<p>I recently re-read <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/tribes-we-need-you-to-lead-us-with-earbuds-seth-godin/15559636?ean=9781591842330"><em>Tribes</em> by Seth Godin</a> to see how it stood up fourteen years after its original publication. Re-reading the book reminded me of the techno-optimism so many of us shared in the early 2000s. Fast forward nearly a decade and half later, and many of the tools we once loved now seem like our worst enemies.</p>
<p>Maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WfRcnF4iZI">Harvey Dent in <em>The Dark Knight</em></a> was talking about the big dogs of Web2 when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either you die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve already said, I&rsquo;m not in the prediction game. But my questions give some insight into my hopes.</p>
<p>And with that, bring on the new year.</p>

			 <p>What if Web3 isn&rsquo;t an evolution but a move to something like the web&rsquo;s original form? Not an arrival but a return. A regression of sorts. A devolution in the most positive context.</p>
<p>These are some of the questions I&rsquo;ve been asking about Web3 over the last few months. And these questions hint to my hopes—but not my predictions—for the future of the web after the apparent falls of <a href="https://twitterisgoinggreat.com/">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-stock-down-earnings-700-billion-in-lost-value/">Meta</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-a-return-to-the-early-days-of-web1-look-like">What would a return to the early days of Web1 look like?</h2>
<p><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-internet-wants-to-be-fragmented">Noah Smith recently wrote</a> what I had previously only spoken:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I first got access to the internet as a kid, the very first thing I did was to find people who liked the same things I liked — science fiction novels and TV shows, Dungeons and Dragons, and so on. In the early days, that was what you did when you got online — you <em>found your people</em>, whether on Usenet or IRC or Web forums or MUSHes and MUDs. Real life was where you had to interact with a bunch of people who rubbed you the wrong way — the coworker who didn’t like your politics, the parents who nagged you to get a real job, the popular kids with their fancy cars. The internet was where you could just go be a dork with other dorks, whether you were an anime fan or a libertarian gun nut or a lonely Christian 40-something or a gay kid who was still in the closet. Community was the escape hatch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s recollection of the early days of the web sum up what many of us are aiming for: A return to a special kind of community, rather than another opportunity to interact with those we already get enough of offline.</p>
<p>The technology of Web2 will not disappear. But how we use such technology may—and should—change.</p>
<p>And so Web3 may not be the next release number but instead a matter of simple math:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Web 3 = Web1 philosophy + Web2 technology</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-exactly-is-the-philosophy-of-web1">What exactly is the philosophy of Web1?</h2>
<p>The philosophy of Web1 basically the promise of Web3: Decentralization. Fragmentation. An internet that&rsquo;s harder to silo into a few sites and services.</p>
<p>write.as founder <a href="https://write.as/matt/what-would-a-real-web3-look-like">Matt Baer has often criticized Web3</a> and made the point that decentralization is already possible through technology we take for granted or may have long forgotten, such as email and <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-use-rss-feeds/">RSS</a>.</p>
<p>Molly White, creator of <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/">Web3 is Going Just Great</a>, has often branded Web3 and its related technologies as solutions in search of a problem. She&rsquo;s also made the point that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGsllEF7w_g">technology on its own rarely solves problems</a>. Change is often aided by other forces such as regulation.</p>
<p>In this case, the change we need must be aided with philosophy, which will then change how people use technology.</p>
<p>This moment in time brings up another point: More technology is not always the answer, especially when we&rsquo;re not properly using the features we already have. So better philosophy and better usage are better paths to seek and take.</p>
<h2 id="whats-so-bad-about-web2-anyway">What&rsquo;s so bad about Web2 anyway?</h2>
<p>Web2 has not benefitted users nearly as much as the few corporations who have used their network effects to consolidate power into a handful of services. This model needs to fall. And I hope—but do not <em>predict</em>—that it will soon.</p>
<p>But Web3 of the crypto/blockchain kind is not the answer. If anything, it will only further complicate the digital landscape.</p>
<p>The technology for decentralization already exists. All we have to do is use it the right way, something we haven&rsquo;t been doing for the last decade or so.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like putting together a puzzle.” That&rsquo;s how my buddy explained oil and gas abstracting. “Does that sound like something you&rsquo;d be interested in?”</p>
<p>Yeah, I told him. I&rsquo;ll give it a shot. I still had no idea what “abstracting” and “chain of title” and “runsheet” and “mineral ownership report” meant, but it all sounded better than selling cars in the middle of the financial crisis.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long to see what he meant by saying that my new job was like putting together a puzzle. And it didn&rsquo;t take long to figure out that I liked the job. And now, all these years later, I&rsquo;ve found myself asking why exactly title research resonated with me, because it wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted to do before February 2008, when I first moved to Texas. Before then, title research wasn&rsquo;t something I realized was even an option.</p>
<p>With oil and gas abstracting, the desired scene of the completed puzzle is always the same: You&rsquo;re trying to get to <strong>1</strong>. No matter how many owners under one tract of land, no matter how fragmented the interest—the final report should be whole. Complete. Like a jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>Through the lens of puzzle-making is another way to look at writing. Whatever we&rsquo;re writing, we&rsquo;re always checking to make sure that we have all the pieces. If we ever feel as if we do have all the pieces, then we have to worry about putting them in the right places. But when we do so, maybe we discover that we&rsquo;ve put together a puzzle different from the one we had in mind when we started. Maybe the final picture doesn&rsquo;t match the one on the box.</p>
<p>Complex title and mineral ownership necessitates a flowchart. I think of flowcharts as roadmaps that show where ownership began—usually with a patent from a state agency to the original grantee of the land—and the path it took to get to its current state. Writing is a bit like a roadmap too, starting readers at one place and then leading them somewhere else at the end.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest problem with this analogy is that our writing most likely never has all the pieces to make everything whole. Something is always missing. And if something&rsquo;s not missing for one reader or audience, that doesn&rsquo;t mean something&rsquo;s not missing for another. Our projects will never be perfect. And we may reach the point of doing more harm than good if we keep cramming in more information at the expense of the flow or of our readers' attention spans and patience.</p>
<p>But still, we have to try to get enough pieces. And we have to lay down the roadmap to show the proper order in which each piece needs to be experienced.</p>
<p>We have to write the puzzle as best we can.</p>

			 <p>So many of us have this habit of romanticizing great writing.</p>
<p>We dream of the genius writers sitting alone at their desks, sipping on a cappuccino as the perfect words flow from their minds through their hands and onto the page.</p>
<p>And so, when we sit down for our own writing, this is the image we&rsquo;re seeking to emulate.</p>
<p>Romanticizing great writing is harmful for a couple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It makes us feel as if we can&rsquo;t write great works because we&rsquo;re not the same kind of genius.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re set up for failure because we think great writing should come so easily.</li>
</ol>
<p>Great writing is hard. Great writing is work.</p>
<p>And great writing is iterative. It comes in steps.</p>
<p>Study the habits of great writers enough and you&rsquo;ll probably read or hear the point that the secret to great writing is rewriting. That&rsquo;s right: Your first draft is probably not going to be on par with the idea of the genius writer in your head.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to have to write and write and write again. AKA rewrite.</p>
<h2 id="structuring-for-iterative-writing">Structuring for iterative writing</h2>
<p>I recently started a new job as a marketing specialist at an IT support firm. Our first order of business is to revamp our website.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already established a basic framework for our new website. But now we need some copy.</p>
<p>Time to put on the writer hat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to let perfectionism get in the way of good ideas.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve started with a scrap file.</p>
<p>Originally I started writing in Notepad on Windows. Then I moved to using Markdown in Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>Then my boss said he wanted to see my ideas and collaborate, so I migrated the scrap file to Microsoft OneNote.</p>
<p>All of that to say you can structure for iterative writing in a variety of apps. Doing so doesn&rsquo;t require any technical ability. Instead, doing so requires the proper mindset.</p>
<p>I have three main topics I&rsquo;m juggling and trying to write copy for.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve structured my scrap file as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unorganized</li>
<li>Topic 1
<ul>
<li>Subtopic 1.1</li>
<li>Subtopic 1.2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Topic 2</li>
<li>Subtopic 2.1</li>
<li>Subtopic 2.2</li>
<li>Topic 3</li>
<li>Subtopic 3.1</li>
<li>Subtopic 3.2</li>
</ul>
<p>As ideas pop into my head, I simply sort them underneath the appropriate topic or subtopic.</p>
<p>“Unorganized” is just what it sounds like—that&rsquo;s where I keep the ideas I can&rsquo;t quite find a home for yet. Or maybe they pertain to parts I&rsquo;m not writing for yet.</p>
<p>This is not the time to focus on one thing and one thing only.</p>
<p>This is the time to let ideas flow. I don&rsquo;t want to reject what may be a good idea because it doesn&rsquo;t fit at the moment.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry too much about structure and the final product. Save formatting for the end.</p>
<p>Besides, finding the perfect font before you start is not going to help your writing.</p>
<p>This is not the time to be precious about your writing.</p>
<h2 id="why-iterative-writing-works">Why iterative writing works</h2>
<p>Iterative writing sets up more realistic expectations.</p>
<p>By demystifying the writing process and seeing how it really works, I can acknowledge that anything I put into my scrap file will likely need a ton of polish to have any chance of making it onto the launched website.</p>
<p>I now know that my writing needs to start with an ideation phase, where I&rsquo;m free to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks.</p>
<p>And from there, I&rsquo;ll work through a series of rewrites until I feel I have something worthy of publishing.</p>

			 <p>Writers often worry about word count. Now that writing has gone digital, many also worry about character count, especially on platforms like Twitter.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-word-count">The problem with word count</h2>
<p>Is word count really what we should be worried about when character count is not an issue?</p>
<p>Word count tells only part of the story.</p>
<p>One word equals one word. But word count alone doesn’t give clues about how difficult a sentence or piece of work is to read.</p>
<p>That’s why we should also consider syllable count.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-for-syllable-count">The case for syllable count</h2>
<p>There’s no point in having fewer words if they’re a mouthful to say.</p>
<p>Copywriters in particular can fall into the trap of excessive syllables. (Hello, jargon and business speak.)</p>
<p>You’ve likely seen ads for products and services promising to <em>maximize profitability</em>. A simpler promise would be to <em>increase profits</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s do some quick maths:</p>
<p><em>Increase profits</em> = 4 syllables</p>
<p><em>Maximize</em> alone = 3 syllables</p>
<p><em>Maximize profitability</em> = lol, I ain’t counting that mess.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-for-the-road">One more for the road</h2>
<p>Another example is <em>fundamentals</em> vs. <em>basics</em>.</p>
<p><em>Fundamentals</em> = 4 syllables</p>
<p><em>Basics</em> = 2 syllables—and it basically means the same thing.</p>
<p>Fewer syllables amount to less information to take in, interpret, process, and act on.</p>
<p>In some situations, focusing on syllables is more efficient than focusing on word count.</p>
<p>Feel free to argue. Or altercate. Whichever fits your syllable preference.</p>

			 <p>Job interviews suck. There&rsquo;s no denying it.</p>
<p>You never know what you&rsquo;re walking into. An interview may be a one-on-one affair, or it may be you seated across from six other people all staring at you like a jury eager to convict.</p>
<p>Or maybe you go through multiple interviews back to back. And there&rsquo;s always the chance someone will join the interview late and ask questions you&rsquo;ve already answered. Of course, the latecomers always ask the questions you had the weakest answers for.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re doing all you can to impress the decision maker(s), you&rsquo;re also deciding if this song and dance is worth it—if the job and the company are a good fit for you.</p>
<p>The worst is when you’re an hour into an interview and you realize you don’t want the job.</p>
<p>While you can’t eliminate these interviews, you can at least identify them quickly. Then you can cut the interview short, or at least not work to extend it. Or, if you can’t save yourself from wasting any more time, you can at least save yourself from wasting any more emotional energy.</p>
<h2 id="one-job-interview-question-you-must-ask">One job interview question you must ask</h2>
<p>There is one question you should be sure to ask in all future job interviews:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What about my credentials made you want to interview me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feel free to ask this question in your own words—don’t worry about asking it verbatim.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-question-is-crucial">Why this question is crucial</h2>
<p>Job interviews are not only about satisfying the needs of the employer; you need to know your value is recognized as well.</p>
<p><strong>Never forget:</strong> You’re interviewing them just as much as they’re interviewing you.</p>
<p>You need to know they understand the skills and experience you offer. You need to know they’ve invested time in getting to know you, just as they need to know you’ve invested time in getting to know them.</p>
<p>Job interviews are a two-way street.</p>
<p>The potential employer’s answer to the question gives insight into what they’ll be like to work with. If they can’t appreciate your past work, there’s a good chance they won’t appreciate your future work either.</p>
<p>But if they answer in a way that shows they’ve paid attention, then you might be on a good path.</p>
<h2 id="dont-just-assume-theyre-paying-attention">Don’t just assume they’re paying attention</h2>
<p>Don’t be surprised if interviewers ask questions that show they haven’t been paying attention.</p>
<p>Recruiters in particular are notorious for reaching out because they saw one keyword on a résumé and thought they’d found their guy or gal. And then when they slow down and start thinking critically, they quickly realize you’re missing 90% of the crucial qualifications.</p>
<p>This question reveals whether they’re paying attention or are just hoping they’ll stumble upon the perfect candidate.</p>
<h2 id="the-credentials-interview-question-in-action">The credentials interview question in action</h2>
<p>I asked a variation of the credentials questions during my most recent job search.</p>
<p><strong>A little background:</strong></p>
<p>I was interviewing for a content manager position after spending nine months as a marketing specialist. Before breaking into marketing, I had spent nearly 14 years as a petroleum landman.</p>
<p>My version of the credentials question went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t have the traditional marketing background.</p>
<p>So what did you see on my résumé, or what feedback from the recruiter made you think I could be a good fit for this position?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My future boss said he had looked over my portfolio pieces and he found my writing to be simple and clear.</p>
<p>This feedback gave me confidence when completing an assessment, and also for my final interview.</p>
<h2 id="quickly-qualify-or-quickly-disqualify">Quickly qualify or quickly disqualify</h2>
<p>Asking this question also tells you what you should focus on when selling yourself for the job. You will have identified what your potential employer sees as your most desirable assets.</p>
<p>On the flip side, if the interviewer values traits you don’t value—or traits you want to get away from—then the job may not be a good fit for you.</p>
<p>The unfortunate truth is that most jobs will not be a good fit. Too many factors go into finding the right job: timing, the company and its culture, your team and leadership, the responsibilities of the position itself.</p>
<p>Your goal in an interview should not be only to get a new job. Your goal should also include identifying the jobs that aren’t a good fit so that you can move on to those that may be worth the trouble.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been rethinking my relationship with technology since I started reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Cal-Newport-audiobook/dp/B07LGDY5PC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3CE9RED6KC5OE&amp;keywords=digital+minimalism&amp;qid=1653942102&amp;sprefix=digital+minimalism%2Caps%2C139&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Digital Minimalism</em> by Cal Newport</a>.</p>
<p>After mentioning this book is usually when a blogger tells his audience he&rsquo;s deleted his social media accounts and can now be reached only by smoke signal.</p>
<p>But this is not that kind of post, dear reader.</p>
<p>I appreciate that <em>Digital Minimalism</em> is not a book of prescriptive, one-size-fits-all advice for living with technology in the 21st century. While Newport himself is no fan of social media, he leaves it up to individuals to define their own relationships with the tech they use regularly. Newport&rsquo;s most important message is that you think about where technology fits in your life, not that we all reach the same conclusions and use or avoid all the same services.</p>
<p><em>Digital Minimalism</em> is not a how-to guide. It is instead a guide calling its readers to develop their own philosophy about where technology fits into their lives.</p>
<p>After I started reading the book, I deleted from my phone nearly every app not related to calling, texting, or navigation.</p>
<p>Newport suggests suspending use of any problematic apps for a month. He refers to this time as the &ldquo;decluttering&rdquo; period. Once the decluttering period is over, you re-introduce the temporarily banned tech back into your usage and observe whether you think it still has a place in your life. Newport claims that often people realize they no longer need the tech, making their decluttering periods permanent.</p>
<p>I made it a week before I reversed my declutter, because I&rsquo;m <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y2eCJeNgc0">lacking in moral fiber</a>. But I have kept <em>most</em> social apps from my phone this go round.</p>
<p>And though I have deviated from Newport&rsquo;s recommendations, I have started creating distance between myself and my phone. I&rsquo;ve started leaving it behind in other rooms of the house. And my short break does seem to have made putting my phone down much easier when I know I need to.</p>
<p>My declutter has made me realize how much I prefer the desktop (or laptop) experience over the mobile experience in most situations. I&rsquo;m an elder millennial, so I&rsquo;m better with a traditional keyboard and mouse than I am with an onscreen keyboard.</p>
<p>I recently got a couple used (or &ldquo;previously enjoyed&rdquo;) laptops through my job. The laptops are nowhere near the latest and greatest specs. They can&rsquo;t upgrade to Windows 11, but they run Linux just fine (currently <a href="https://getsol.us/home/">Solus</a>).</p>
<p>Still, these laptops are thin and powerful enough for everything I need. Ten or fifteen years ago, it would been impossible to think of how I could ever need anything more. Especially when you consider the near ubiquity of public wifi.</p>
<p>But now, in the age of smartphones, we want the same conveniences once reserved for laptops at our disposal through these devices many of us keep in our pockets at all times.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s easy to gush over tech like laptops when propping it against the smartphone. Perhaps the smartphone is a scapegoat, the villainous flavor of the week.</p>
<p>I do not believe eliminating smartphones will fix everything. We would find a substitute for distraction, perhaps laptops and desktop computers.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a problem we can address when we&rsquo;ve improved our relationships with our smartphones. This acknowledgment makes us better prepared in the war for our attention.</p>
<p>While Newport doesn&rsquo;t say everyone should delete all social media, he doesn&rsquo;t hide his opinion that social media holds little to no value. These days it&rsquo;s fashionable to jump on Newport&rsquo;s side and crap on social media while ignoring any benefits.</p>
<p>The reason I fell in love with the Internet way back in the late &rsquo;90s is the same reason I stick around on social media and related platforms in 2022: The potential for connection that&rsquo;s harder to find offline.</p>
<p>Connections made over the Internet are not a substitute for connections with my family and other people I see offline. While I can get along with almost anyone I meet face to face, there are very few I can nerd out with on anything that truly interests me. Or at least not to the depth I want to go.</p>
<p>Also, I tend to hop from interest to interest. It&rsquo;s always nice to know I can find other parties interested in the same things, on the Internet, often in the form of social media.</p>
<p>Perhaps I would feel differently if I were part of some sort of establishment I could fall back on.</p>
<p>But I would be disingenuous to gloss over my gripes with social media, which relies on sloppy algorithms to decide which content is worth promoting. (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Meta, LinkedIn, Twitter . . .)</p>
<p>When I think back to my favorite times in online communities, they were often in communities that hadn&rsquo;t yet been adopted by the masses. And while that may make me sound like an idealistic hipster who wants to keep his hangouts under the radar so that he can have them all to himself, I find my defense more practical than that.</p>
<p>The simple truth is that, in most cases:</p>
<p><strong>Mass adoption = commoditization.</strong></p>
<p>And once you start catering to everyone, you end up serving no one. And, at some point, the experiences all run together, as the users and their avatars do. And you get an experience similar to what you likely find offline, in which few of the experiences stand out above the rest.</p>
<p>Before reading <em>Digital Minimalism</em>, I was becoming convinced that a return to smaller online communities was the best path forward. I still believe that in theory, though I haven&rsquo;t begun practicing it as well as I should.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure of the exact limits of this practice either. Obvious candidates include places like <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> and niche Mastodon servers. Maybe even the smaller subreddits. I suppose you can create an insular experience on Twitter if you follow the right people.</p>
<p>While I would like to see a break from <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/web-2-ending?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2">the worst of Web 2.0</a>, I&rsquo;m thinking <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/">Web 3.0 is most likely not the answer</a>.</p>
<p>Does that mean Newport&rsquo;s preference for walking away from social media is the answer?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not ready to jump on that train. But I can&rsquo;t blame anyone who does.</p>
<p>I hope this essay shines some light on the need for philosophy in all aspects of our lives, even in technology.</p>

			 <p>Part of succeeding in the real world is unlearning what school has taught you. This is especially true with writing.</p>
<p>So what are some of the lessons writers need to unlearn?</p>
<h2 id="forget-minimum-word-counts">Forget minimum word counts.</h2>
<p>School teaches us to drag out our writing, to string audiences along as we inflate our writing to meet some arbitrary minimum word count.</p>
<p>Enforcing a strict <em>maximum</em> word count would be far more effective. Teachers should ask the impossible of students. Require students to argue for or against organized religion or capital punishment in 200 words. Or 100 words.</p>
<p><em>But that doesn&rsquo;t give me enough to work with, to make my point</em>, students may complain.</p>
<p>Welcome to the real world, kid. Take your best shot with the parameters you have.</p>
<h2 id="get-to-the-point">Get to the point.</h2>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard the joke about the formula for academic writing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell them what you&rsquo;re going to tell them.</li>
<li>Tell them.</li>
<li>Tell them what you told them.</li>
</ol>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Tell them—and while you&rsquo;re telling them, tell them why they should care. Make sure the <em>why</em> is woven throughout your writing.</p>
<p>Your teachers will read whatever you submit because they have to. That&rsquo;s their job. That&rsquo;s what they get paid for.</p>
<p>Most people outside the classroom do not have to read your writing. So don&rsquo;t assume you&rsquo;ll keep their attention just because you showed up.</p>
<h2 id="dont-be-a-grammar-purist">Don&rsquo;t be a grammar purist.</h2>
<p>Writing is about communication and connection. It ain&rsquo;t about having the rightest sentences.</p>
<p>You can start sentences with conjunctions. And you shouldn&rsquo;t feel bad about it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up about ending a sentence with a preposition. There are more important things to worry about.</p>
<p>Fragments are fine. Really.</p>
<p>Just be sure it works for your context and audience. (That last bit is good life advice, not just writing advice.)</p>
<h2 id="study-copywriting">Study copywriting.</h2>
<p>Copywriters are writers who consistently get paid for their writing. The best can turn a few everyday words into phrases that stick in an audience&rsquo;s mind for decades.</p>
<p>How do they do it? What can you learn from studying copywriting? How can you bring those lessons to your own writing?</p>
<h2 id="that-aint-all">That ain&rsquo;t all.</h2>
<p>This is hardly a comprehensive list.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s somewhere to start.</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;ve ever sought advice to combat writer&rsquo;s block or to rediscover inspiration, you&rsquo;ve likely stumbled upon the advice to go on a walk. And if you&rsquo;re in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, I would amend that advice by recommending you take a walk on the Rock Art Tail in Grapevine&rsquo;s Parr Park.</p>
<p>The Parr Park Rock Art Trail is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: a path lined with painted and decorated rocks. The rocks come in all sizes, shapes, and flavors.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, many works professed the creator&rsquo;s love of the Great State.</p>

<p>Some rocks celebrated alma maters or cartoon and comic book characters. Some were pieces of larger works.</p>

<p>Some rocks were products of their time.

<p>Some rocks were intended to be inspirational.</p>

<p>Some sought to give practical advice.</p>

<p>And some were pure silliness.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2024/2021-09-1108.02.38.jpg" alt="Pet rock cemetery at the Parr Park Rock Art Trail"></p>
<p>But collectively, the rocks filled me with wonder. I marveled at the work that went into creating some of the rock art. The effort to paint the scenes. The time spent to find the perfect rock. How many people poked out their chests as they boasted about their participation in <a href="https://www.chron.com/life/article/Texas-Grapeline-park-pebble-display-Guinness-16458004.php">a Guinness record</a>?</p>
<p>The trail served as a reminder of our desire to be a part of something, and a reminder that, regardless of what some people or outlets may make you believe, there are still beautiful somethings to be part of.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>If you had to sum up in only a few sentences the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeWork">WeWork</a> debacle to someone unfamiliar with the situation, how would you do so? The following quote from <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cult-We-Neumann-Startup-Delusion-ebook/dp/B08FHC77MT/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=The+cult+of+we&amp;qid=1630936360&amp;sr=8-1">The Cult of We: WeWork, Adam Neumann, and the Great Startup Delusion</a></em> by Eliot Brown and Maureen Farrell would be my candidate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But prior to the prospectus becoming public, bankers and other advisers had continued to shower [Adam] Neumann with praise&ndash;giving him criticism too infrequently and too meekly. These advisers either ignored or danced around the company&rsquo;s obvious warts and red flags.</p>
<p>Now, at the eleventh hour, they finally spoke up. But the IPO was already on life support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have any interest in investing time reading about business train wrecks rather than investing your money into them, then pick up a copy of <em>The Cult of We</em>. Throughout the book, I often found myself shaking my head in disbelief, amazed at how many smart and successful people overlooked what should have been obvious red flags, such as CEO Adam Neumann&rsquo;s selling too many shares too soon, Neumann&rsquo;s constant power grabs, a private company buying a $63 million private jet even though it was hemorrhaging cash despite having had plenty time to find a path to profitability&ndash;the list goes on.</p>
<p>WeWork&rsquo;s business model was simple. They leased up office buildings, prettied the spaces up to attract Millennials, and subleased the space at a premium. Their plan was hardly unique, as Regus had done the same a couple decades earlier. No matter how you cut it, WeWork was a real estate company. Yet many viewed it as a tech company, which justified the crazy valuations it had received before its IPO. WeWork would not have been valued so high if it were seen as a real estate company, since real estate companies are unable to scale as well as tech companies. It was the era of the visionary founder, and if the founder said WeWork was a tech company, then it must be a tech company.</p>
<p>Neumann and Masayoshi Son, the head of SoftBank, had convinced themselves that WeWork was a $10 trillion company, basically because they dared to dream so. The authors point out that, <em>in 2018, the entire value of the U.S. stock market was $30 trillion.</em> (Take a moment to let that sink in.)</p>
<p>Neumann and Son laid out a plan to reach the ambitious valuation while never acknowledging all the obstacles they would face. Neumann believed he could change the world in myriad ways: from how people work and live to how they educate their children.</p>
<p>Neumann and his wife Rebeka had convinced themselves they were environmentalists despite riding freely on the aforementioned private jet and even taking an abundance of WeWork&rsquo;s unused couches to landfills. Rebeka had described the family as minimalists despite having at one time owned at least eight homes.</p>
<p>In summary, the delusions ran far and wide.</p>
<p>The story was a reminder of a crucial life lesson: Don&rsquo;t be afraid to question the herd; just because the herd buys into the same narrative doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re right. And you&rsquo;re not wrong to question the herd.</p>
<p>The story also reminded me of similar moments I&rsquo;ve experienced in thirteen years as a petroleum landman.</p>
<p>The first such moment came early in my career, when I was working in Dallas-Fort Worth&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_Shale">Barnett Shale</a> play. In the shadow of the Great Recession, the natural gas play was a bright spot and a boost to the local economy. Everyone involved in the industry was in high spirits, some even claiming the boom times could last 20 years. I remember raising an eyebrow at that declaration. I couldn&rsquo;t make a convincing case for why the boom wouldn&rsquo;t last 20 years, other than a feeling in my gut that such good times are unlikely to last so long. Within 13 months, my employer had closed its Fort Worth office and most of the former occupants were looking for jobs, as natural gas crashed from all-time highs and is only now, over a decade later, showing signs of significant recovery.</p>
<p>The second such moment came when I moved to West Texas in 2012. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian_Basin_(North_America)">Permian Basin</a> is no stranger to boom-and-bust cycles, so the narrative wasn&rsquo;t exactly the same as the Barnett Shale in 2008-2009. Instead, the collective wisdom was: <em>This boom is different</em>, whatever that meant. While the Permian Basin does not appear to be at risk of going the way of the Barnett, the area has still seen fluctuations in the near-decade since. The cycle of booms and busts is more frequent than in past decades, but the cycle still exists.</p>
<p><em>The Cult of We</em> is not just a business book or a biography of a company that went from rising star to laughing stock in the blink of an eye. The book is also a warning: Never underestimate someone&rsquo;s ability to be out of touch with reality.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I entered college knowing only that I wanted to write for a living.</p>
<p>I had accepted that I wasn&rsquo;t going to support myself on the paperback royalties of novels I would never write. Technical writing sounded unimaginative, and I&rsquo;m not sure my university offered such a program anyway. Therefore, journalism seemed my only option, so I stepped onto campus as a journalism major. By the end of my first quarter, I had switched to Undecided, as I then had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, but journalism was not part of those future plans. Fast forward to 2021, and I doubt anyone would say with a straight face that I made the wrong decision. But I can say with the straightest of faces that I made the right decision for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember much of my time in Journalism 101 other than I got an A for the course. In terms of writing, the most practical takeaway was to lead with a hard-hitting point and then follow with the details and backstory. I didn&rsquo;t immediately realize how this method could also apply to fiction, the best example I can think of being the opening of <em>Choke</em> by Chuck Palahniuk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to read this, don&rsquo;t bother.</p>
<p>After a couple of pages, you won&rsquo;t want to be here. So forget it. Go away. Get out while you&rsquo;re still in one piece.</p>
<p>Save yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has to be something better on television . . .</p>
<p>Those opening lines may not have given me many concrete details about the story that followed, but they gave me enough to get the feel. And I was immediately hooked.</p>
<p>In my journalism course, I quickly discovered I did not want to engage in strictly fact-based writing with no obvious way to inject at least a part of myself into my writing. (I never claimed to be a selfless writer.) I had not yet discovered the likes of Joan Didion, Hunter S. Thompson, or Truman Capote&rsquo;s <em>In Cold Blood</em>, though I doubt these discoveries would have made much difference, because I also left journalism for more practical reasons.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve already stated, I don&rsquo;t remember much of the lectures from Journalism 101, but I do remember something I never experienced in any other entry-level course, which highlights one of the failings of higher education.</p>
<p>Every couple weeks or so, Dr. Blick welcome journalists to share  with the class their experiences in the field. The topics ranged from the humorous, as in the case of a now fellow alum whose typo in the school paper made its way to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FY1n8o20jY">Jay Leno&rsquo;s Headlines segment</a> (She referred to a play version of <em>Lean On Me</em> as <em>Leon On Me</em>), to groundbreaking, as in the case of Leesha Faulkner, who uncovered the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission, a state agency dedicated to derailing the Civil Rights movement.</p>
<p>Despite the diversity in perspective and experience, I heard the same things repeated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You work really hard.</p>
<p>You have no security.</p>
<p>You never see your family.</p>
<p>You make no money.</p>
<p><em>But it&rsquo;s great</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t need to take on student loans just to be broke. After accepting I had no clues what I wanted to do, I tried my hand in computer science, only to crash and burn and then settle on a marketing degree.</p>
<p>In the name of being a real adult, I mostly abandoned writing, save for a handful of short-lived blogs here and there over the years. Within the last three years, I&rsquo;ve started focusing on writing again, starting with dipping my toes back into fiction. I&rsquo;ve studied the craft as I never had before, with a more open mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now read books on screenwriting and have marveled at how much a screenwriter must convey with so few words. Previously, I didn&rsquo;t realize how much the writer directs certain details, holding everyone&rsquo;s hand in the process.</p>
<p>Studying copywriting is another study in communicating efficiently. The best slogans are simple. They require no explanation. They&rsquo;re like jokes: If they require explanation, then they&rsquo;re not effective. You remember effective slogans because they slide off the tongue and have a certain rhythm. These are some of the reasons the most nonsensical song lyrics can lodge themselves into our brains.</p>
<p>From studying technical writing, I&rsquo;ve learned the values of knowing when to holds readers' hands and when to squeeze tightly. I now see that a career of explaining complex issues in oil and gas title has taught much of the same. And I&rsquo;ve also learned that most people who say they don&rsquo;t have the time to hold someone else&rsquo;s hand through an issue most likely lack the knowledge and awareness of how to do so and also have no desire to learn how.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been asking myself recently what is <em>the</em> strand that ties all writing together. What is the one similarity? The unifier, other than a need to communicate?</p>
<p>And, as we speak, my answer is: persuasion.</p>
<p>The angle of persuasion is obvious for some fields, such as legal writing, in which briefs are intended to persuade a judge to rule in a client&rsquo;s favor. Sales copy aims to persuade you to make a certain purchase. Business emails persuade recipients to act&ndash;or maybe they persuade that no action is needed. Even research papers should aim to persuade, as we don&rsquo;t have to look too hard around us to see that facts alone are not enough. If nothing else, I have to persuade you that my facts are more accurate than your facts.</p>
<p>But what about fiction? Where&rsquo;s the persuasion there?</p>
<p>In fiction, authors are trying to persuade readers that this fake world with these fake people in these fake scenarios contains some sort of truth worth their time. Authors want to convince readers that this person in this situation would act or feel a certain way.</p>
<p>And sometimes the persuasion takes a different angle, such as in the case of some of the best tellers of tall tales, the ones who stretch the truth&ndash;or, in some cases, discard the truth completely&ndash;and leave us doubled over, hoarse from laughing through the tears. Sometimes writers persuade us not to care about reality so much.</p>
<p>In the past, I abandoned writing because I failed to see the similarities among the separate disciplines. I also failed to see that there is no down side to being a better writer. Even if you never make a penny directly from your writing, the thought and effort required to improve as a writer likely benefit you in  less obvious ways.</p>
<p>Now, if I read something as mundane as the back of a shampoo bottle, I no longer brush it off as an irrelevant form of writing. Instead, I wonder why certain things were done certain ways and then ask if or how my own projects could benefit from those methods. This way of thinking makes me a more open-minded writer than I was when I set foot on that university campus all those years ago.</p>

			 <p>When you hear about Texas, a few things may come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cowboys</li>
<li>The Alamo</li>
<li>Salsa and cheese dip</li>
<li>Big AF state</li>
</ul>
<p>You likely don&rsquo;t think of the state as possibly being home to America&rsquo;s first UFO crash, which took place 50 years before the better-known Roswell incident. From my experience, most people in the Dallas-Fort Worth area are unaware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Texas,_UFO_incident">Aurora, Texas, UFO incident</a>, even though it happened practically in their back yard.</p>
<p>Long story short, way back in 1897&ndash;before the Wright brothers blasted their fly rides into the sky and made it cry&ndash;a cigar-shaped spaceship wrecked into a windmill on the judge&rsquo;s property. The pilot, some tiny human-like creature, was buried in the local cemetery.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2024/2020-04-2514.19.09.jpg" alt="The alien grave in Aurora, Texas">
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>The alien grave in Aurora, Texas</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Of course, any good alien story has to have some additional layers to it.</p>
<p>Supposedly, some metal from the wreckage was thrown into the property&rsquo;s water well and a future owner would claim that the well water gave him gout and so he closed the well in.</p>
<p>When the locals buried the little alien man, they left a grave marker, which was supposedly later retrieved by the army. Truth ears have replaced the marker numerous times with some sort of rock or object over the decades. The cemetery will not allow anyone to exhume the alien, but <a href="https://youtu.be/nOHpQd7TtFg">according to the History Channel&rsquo;s UFO Hunters</a>, there is a collapsed and deteriorated grave at the alien&rsquo;s plot.</p>
<p>Perhaps this story isn&rsquo;t better known because it has been nearly unanimously accepted as legend and was most likely a PR stunt by a local journalist to stir up interest in the dying town. But it&rsquo;s one I like to tell when I get the chance.</p>
<p>I do not believe in aliens insofar as little green men flying around in bubbly spaceships with strange lights and looking for people to abduct for the sake of a little probing action, but I do love the story behind the Aurora, Texas, UFO incident, so from time to time I go to visit the alien grave. And that&rsquo;s what the LaCaze family did this past weekend, while following proper social distancing etiquette, of course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve visited the grave a handful of times over the years, and I never know what to expect before arriving. Before my first visit, someone had stolen the marker for the grave, so I had to rely on blogs and other resources to locate the grave on my own. I would not be surprised if I wrongly identified the spot during my first visit.</p>
<p>For my last few visits, rocks have served as a marker. People often leave little trinkets for the alien, and this past visit featured the most absurd collection I&rsquo;ve yet to see.</p>
<p>During my latest visit to the alien grave, I regretted not visiting Roswell during the five years I lived in West Texas. The drive would not have been terribly long, and I had plenty of free weekends to cross state lines and gawk at some hokey alien stuff and listen to <a href="https://song.link/us/i/1025319113">&ldquo;The Happening&rdquo; by Pixies</a> on repeat. I was also reminded of why I enjoy investigating local abandoned places and local ghost stories and such&ndash;the stories, man. The stories, which can often entertain while also revealing something deeper about us: our anxieties, our hopes, our pains, our desperation.</p>
<p>My son was weirded out by the idea of an alien being buried in the Aurora cemetery. Even after I asked him how he could doubt it after seeing the grave, he held on to his skepticism. I was proud that he was not so easily swayed even by parental pressure, but I hope he was still able to enjoy the lore&ndash;the story&ndash; of it all.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>From time to time, someone will accuse me of having a morbid fascination with death. But <em>fascination</em> is inaccurate; my relationship with death is closer to a familiarity slowly working its way to acceptance. Death and the resulting losses and grief have had a big influence on me over the last few years. In short, loss has opened my eyes to certain realities, has shaped so many of my views, and has changed the very essence of who I am.</p>
<p>In the Spring of 2011, my mother was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. The news came as a heavy blow. Then, a few months later, my father received a similar diagnosis: lung cancer, though a different form. If that wasn’t enough to try to deal with, the progressions of their cancers certainly were.</p>
<p>My mother’s battle with cancer lasted seven or eight months. About four months before she ultimately passed away, she was pronounced dead when she stopped breathing for a few minutes. Per my mother’s wishes, my stepfather fulfilled the unenviable task of asking the doctor not to resuscitate her. But somehow my mother sprang back to life and continued fighting for a few more months before ultimately passing away a couple days after Thanksgiving. During that time, everyone around her watched her deteriorate and wither away. Those images still haunt me going on seven years later. As strange as this may sound, it’s easier to accept her death than it is to accept how she died. Whether logical or not, I can’t help feeling that a similar fate awaits me at some point.</p>
<p>Unlike the case with my mother, my father passed away quickly after his diagnosis. He didn’t quite make it a month. I was scheduled to visit him two days after he passed. To make matters worse, I hadn’t seen my father in about two and a half years. So, that obviously brings its own pains and guilt that I don’t think I need to explain or elaborate.</p>
<p>The losses didn’t stop there. In 2014, I lost my stepfather, who passed away due to complications from diabetes. Unlike the case with my parents, his death caught me completely off-guard. I knew that he was having health problems, but I had never considered the possibility of death. Or if I had, I likely felt that death would be a bit further down the road.</p>
<p>Whenever I relay these details, I catch myself wondering if that is indeed how it happened. Even now, just the thought of having to deal with those losses in such fashion shakes me. These losses were so close together — especially the losses of my parents — and each played out in its own unique way. When I contrast and compare them, I’m able to come up with a variety of takeaways that I feel are worth sharing.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-no-perfect-closure">There is no perfect closure.</h2>
<p>Some of us are concerned with having an ideal death. We convince ourselves that if things play out a certain way, the whole experience won’t be too painful.</p>
<p>Each loss I suffered brought unique grief. I can’t say I fully prefer one to the other. While I’m grateful that I was able to have more time with my mother, I know every moment she was alive created pain and torture for her. I can only imagine the conflict of wanting your suffering to end but also knowing that the end will come only when you&rsquo;ve passed. Looking back, I now realize what a gift it is to have no hatchets to bury and no wrongs to right. If you have the opportunity to set things right before tragedy strikes, I highly recommend that you do it. Doing so will allow you to focus on the things that truly matter and will help to bring a little order to the chaos.</p>
<p>I wish I’d had the opportunity to see my father one last time, but at least he didn’t have to suffer as long as my mother did. While his quick passing brings its own comforts, it also denied the opportunity for certain conversations I wish we&rsquo;d had. If I’m being completely honest and self-aware, I likely wouldn’t have had the courage to initiate these conversations, as it’s taken me nearly seven years to sort through my feelings to articulate said feelings. But as things played out, I never had the chance. And that’s something I wish I could change.</p>
<p>And with my stepfather’s passing, I learned what it was like to be shocked when someone leaves this world without warning. There’s a big difference between accepting that someone has finally passed and accepting that someone has abruptly passed. But both situations have one thing in common–pain and suffering. You can sit around and philosophize about which flavor of grief you prefer, but at the end of the day you’re still eating a dish you wish you’d never been served. Kind of like Grandma’s <a href="https://www.riverfronttimes.com/foodblog/2010/02/16/20-unholy-recipes-dishes-so-awful-we-had-to-make-them">vienna sausage shortcake</a>.</p>
<h2 id="grief-is-not-linear">Grief is not linear.</h2>
<p>Rather than acknowledge my grief and seek help of any sort, I repeatedly told myself that I should be over it by now. It’d been a year or two years or three years — how long was I going to take to get over these deaths? When would I be okay? When would I feel normal again?</p>
<p>I’ve accepted I will never get over these losses. Instead, I must continue to learn to live with them. I’ve come to realize that on any given day, I have no clue what will trigger or stir a reaction in me. Just when I think it’ll never bother me again, I watch a movie or a TV show centered around the themes of death and loss and my eyes fill up. Even though I can’t articulate what exactly is going on inside, I allow myself to feel it. And that’s something that took years to find the courage to do.</p>
<p>The journey is not straight. Along the way you’ll encounter many strange paths, and at times you may find yourself feeling as if you’re possibly regressing. That’s okay; it’s part of the process. You can’t take your hands off the wheel and just coast to the finish line; get ready for some curves and u-turns.</p>
<p><em>The only way out is through.</em></p>
<p>So stop <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XN0NtrnfMY">looking forward on paths sideways</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dont-invalidate-your-grief">Don’t invalidate your grief.</h2>
<p>At some point, I realized I wasn’t giving myself permission to grieve. This halted my healing for years. One way I denied my grief was by telling myself that there were some who had had it far worse.</p>
<p>*Some people lost their parents when they were much younger.</p>
<p>Some people had lost family due to murder or wars.*</p>
<p>Comparing and contrasting grief in this manner does little good. The fact remains that my experience still sucked, and I have no problem saying that now. When I say it, I’m not asking for pity. I’m simply acknowledging the situation.</p>
<p><em>It sucked. It still does.</em></p>
<p>When I think about this point, I’m always reminded of the time I heard a hospice representative ask, “What is the greatest pain the world?”</p>
<p>The group I was in offered various answers, but the most popular answer by far was <em>the death of a child</em>. Who’s going to argue that one, right?</p>
<p>But I now realize that the death of a child can be the greatest pain in the world only if you’ve experienced it, because as the the hospice worker made me realize when she answered her question, the greatest pain in the world is whatever pain you’re experiencing at the moment. This realization has made it easier for me to offer compassion to the pains of others as well as the pains of my own. In the end, it doesn’t matter how my pain stacks up to others’; my pain is my own, and it’s the only pain I know.</p>
<p>Also, dealing with these kinds of matters is a balance. Yes, there are times when you have to box up your feelings and get through the day. But you do have to give yourself the opportunity to be real about how you’re feeling. Or how else can you hope to improve your feelings if you never acknowledge their true intricacies?</p>
<h2 id="bring-on-the-empathy">Bring on the empathy.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“I always cry at funerals, even if I didn’t know the person.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>— My Uncle Cecil, at my grandfather’s funeral</p>
<p>I was fifteen years old when I heard those words from my Uncle Cecil. At the time, I hadn’t had the life experience to understand and appreciate what he was saying. But I like to think I now have a much better idea, because these days I never know when a certain moment will move me to tears. Maybe the tears will come when a co-worker starts crying during her retirement party when she becomes a mess of emotions as she’s so excited to say hello to a new chapter of her life while she’s also afraid of saying goodbye to a familiar chapter. Or maybe they’ll come when I find myself an absolute mess at the end of <em>The Iron Giant</em>. (Before you ask, yes, both of those things have actually happened.)</p>
<p>While these moments lead to embarrassment, they also allow for greater connection with others as well as with myself. Sometimes these moments are in no way obviously related to my experiences with loss. I like to think that simply being reminded time and time again about the fleeting nature of life has given me an ability to realize emotions that were once unreachable. Regardless of whether my theory is spot-on or completely vain, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee925OTFBCA">sometimes you just need a good cry</a></p>
<h2 id="death-is-something-we-need-to-talk-about-more">Death is something we need to talk about more.</h2>
<p>Death is inevitable, no matter how hard we try to deny it. Death is the last major event of life. We need to acknowledge this without letting fear get in the way. The least we can do is try to face our end with some dignity.</p>
<p>For the first couple years of my son’s life, I felt bad for him because before he was even born, he’d already lost out on so much love from people expected to be close to him. While I’m still bothered by this fact, it does help to know that I have the opportunity to teach him things that most parents aren’t equipped for. I’m still not sure about the timing or the exact technique, but I do understand the importance and I know that it’s something I won’t back down from.</p>
<p>Death and loss are part of the human experience, and we’re doing ourselves a disservice when we refuse to acknowledge that fact. Also, I like to think that as we become more comfortable with the certainty of death, we also find the clarity for better living.</p>
<h2 id="it-feels-good-to-think-i-can-help-others">It feels good to think I can help others.</h2>
<p>One thing that lessens the pain is finding a way to come away with lessons from this experience. And it helps more if I can find a way to pass those lessons on to others who may need them. I’m aware what the pain of loss is like, and if I can help to alleviate that pain for someone else for even a tiny bit, I consider it a good deed done. I’ve also learned that it often helps to know that you’re not alone, no matter what’s ailing you.</p>
<h2 id="but-if-im-being-honest-it-isnt-all-about-helping-others">But if I’m being honest, it isn’t all about helping others.</h2>
<p>I wish I could claim to be completely selfless. But the truth is that talking about my experience is an outlet, and finding outlets helps me. Also, every time I’m able to share my story, I find something new. I find another layer to the onion. I take away something new, and I grow just a little bit more. And so I like to think that by helping myself I’m able to help others, which may not sound very altruistic. But it’s real.</p>
<p>Refusing to be real about this part of my life took a toll on me in many ways. It beat me down and got the best of me. It filled a significant chunk of my life with darkness and robbed me of so much potential joy. In short, it wasn’t working. And when what you’ve been trying hasn’t been working, it’s time to try something new. And this post is part of my effort to be more open about my experience.</p>
<p>Thank you for me letting me share a bit of myself with you.</p>

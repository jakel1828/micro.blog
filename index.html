  <p>I’m just a dude on the internet asking what it means to be human in the age of AI.</p>
<p>Except for just over a year in tech marketing, I’ve spent my working life as an oil and gas land professional. But, considering the role tech plays in our lives, you don’t need to work in tech to have authority to talk about tech.</p>
<p>Tech (and our usage of it) deserve to be a focus of modern philosophy. And, at least for now, that is the point of this blog: To question the roles tech plays–and should or should not play–in 21st century living.</p>

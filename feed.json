				"content_text": "<p>Over the last few months, I’ve been asking myself if I’ve been turning into a Communist, as certain aspects of capitalism have had me seeing red.</p>\n\n<p>So many parts of the capitalist system feel broken, especially when companies lay off thousands of workers, only to then perform stock buybacks with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars that could have paid the salaries of those terminated workers for at least a couple extra decades. And when companies perform buybacks, they’re not investing in their employees or improving the infrastructure of the company. They’re simply prioritizing shareholders, which is a quick way to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/08/google-staffers-question-execs-over-decline-in-morale-after-earnings.html\">kill morale</a>. Perhaps this situation wouldn’t be such a big deal if companies would admit that labor is little more than a transactional relationship and would so encourage employees to act in the same way. Instead, <a href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/should-you-call-your-team-a-family/\">employees are expected to give their all</a>, while they can be cut loose for the good for the Company.</p>\n\n<p>But after Lina Khan and the <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-announces-rule-banning-noncompetes\">FTC banned noncompete agreements</a> (at least for now), I realized I haven’t turned anti-capitalist. In fact, I’m quite pro-capitalist. I merely want a system more nearly representing the merits of capitalism I’ve been sold as a red-blooded American. To bring that system into reality, we need to ensure that the rules of capitalism apply to corporations as well as individuals. To some degree, the same rules should apply for all parties involved.</p>\n\n<p>Corporations can’t help being selfish and sociopathic. Some may argue that <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2011/08/11/139551684/romneys-corporations-are-people-getting-lots-of-mileage&ved=2ahUKEwiM-5_yjbiGAxUvLkQIHaTsC54QFnoECCIQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0wJbf-JXRk--osCcGEL4R9\">corporations are people</a>, but how can they be when they have no flesh and blood, when they can live on into eternity as long as they make enough money to stay afloat? That’s why we need competition and regulars to <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/18/market-discipline/\">keep corporations on the right path</a>. But we’ve let corporations down over the last few decades. We gave them too much freedom and they’ve shown they can’t handle it. Now we’re stuck with troublesome <a href=\"https://jakelacaze.com/2024/05/14/friends-dont-let.html\">monopolies</a> that are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/big-firms-like-ticketmaster-can-become-too-big-care-ftc-chair-says-2022-12-06/\">too big to care</a> and that are active in an enshittification campaign that hurts customers in a number of ways. With capital costs now being higher than they’ve been in decades, we can’t rely on a wave of startups to right the markets.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike humans who have a limited lifespan, corporations can exist indefinitely. So we must always be ready to steer them in the right direction. Like any parents, we must do certain things not because we’re big, bad poopyhead meanies, but because we have to do what’s ultimately best for all the group as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Capitalism might be in a bit of a crisis. It’s getting harder not to take seriously the claims we’ve hit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/\">late stage capitalism</a>. Especially now as the tech sector, which has dominated the stock market in the 21st century, appears to have run out of good ideas aside from yelling, ‘AI! Get your AI here!’ at every street corner. Even the once might Apple now has little to offer beyond <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2024/05/09/apple-crush-hydraulic-press-ad-criticism/\">a thinner iPad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Before we can reform capitalism, we must first ask if it’s worth saving. I think it is. And so must the swaths of immigrants who enter America, whether by means legal or illegal, every year. If those people were merely running away from something, they’d have plenty of other options. So is it wrong to imagine they’re running toward something when they choose America? Might that thing be an economic model they believe gives them the chance at a better life? And if you argue that such a system doesn’t actually exist here, isn’t that all the more reason to reform capitalism to more nearly match it?</p>\n\n<p>I’m not convinced the base game of capitalism is broken. I like the idea of being able to change my lot with a combination of opportunity, work and skills, and luck. While Hollywood won’t be releasing my biopic anytime soon, I consider myself a homegrown American success story. Raised in a trailer house in the Louisiana Delta, I’m now building a middle-class life in the Lone Star State. Those born in poverty should have the opportunity to rise above and beyond the class they’re born into. This possibility may be a dream, but in an age where we collectively have fewer dreams and heroes, we must protect the fewer we have left.</p>\n\n<p>But the dream of capitalism must be real, especially as the global economy shifts in the coming decades thanks to deglobalization and aging populations. I can’t help feeling a sense of dread at the possibility of a small handful of corporations owning bigger slices of the pie as the economy contracts. It seems to me that we need a more dynamic version of capitalism. One in which innovations wins and one that challenges the behemoth corporations to remain relevant rather than survive as protected incumbents.</p>\n\n<p>How exactly do we bring about this ideal form of capitalism? I don’t have the answer. (But if you do, <a href=\"/about\">I’d love to hear from you</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>But going forward, I expect this topic to bounce around every corner of my mind. It might become one of my prolonged obsessions. And that’s all right, because I think is a question worth obsessing over.</p>\n\n*Jake LaCaze sometimes forgets to add his mini-bio to his blog posts.

But when the Klansmen looked over the bridge, Washburn was nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p>Some versions of the story say that the Klansmen panicked and then burned down Washburn’s home, killing his wife and children. The Klansmen fled.

Only now do I realize these details don’t appear to have popped up in my reading on the tale.\n\n## Beyond Goatman’s Bridge\nGoatman’s Bridge likely wouldn’t be so eerie if it were in a wide-open area. But it’s near some woods, which add to the mystery. \n\nMy son and I started exploring the surrounding woods but didn’t go too far due to mud courtesy of the previous night’s storm.\n\nIf you believe in the Goatman, I think you have to ask where he hides out during the majority of the time, when he’s not haunting. This swamp looks like a good home for a half man, half-goat creature.\n\n![Swamp near Goatman’s Bridge in Denton, Texas](https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2024/goatmans-bridge-marsh.jpg)\n\n## Learn more about Goatman’s Bridge\nTo learn more about Goatman’s Bridge, watch this video from Buzzfeed’s *Unsolved* series and read the articles below.\n\n{{< youtube XEZfGlyLQnA >}}\n\n---\n\n## References\n1.

And no one’s made this tech profitable yet.\n\nIt ain’t looking good, at least until someone makes some kind of algorithmic discovery and improvement to AI. Until then, be *extra* careful of anything you read on the internet.\n\n*Jake LaCaze totally used Claude to proofread this blog post crapping on LLMs.*\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Every once in a while on online forums, I'll stumble across someone asking if you can appear professional while running your business behind a Gmail address. What about Yahoo!, or Hotmail?</p>\n\n<p>You could spend hours debating this topic. And you can spend hours more debating whether it <em>should</em> matter. But by the time you’ve hashed out the details, you could have just set up your email on your own domain and knocked out one of the simplest marketing upgrades available to any digital citizen.</p>\n\n<p>While you have countless options for setting up your email on your own domain, I’m going to share why I’ve used Fastmail for my personal email since moving away from Gmail nearly six years ago.</p>\n\n<h2>A bit about Fastmail</h2>\n\n<p>For those who don’t know, Fastmail is simply awesome.</p>\n\n<p>The service lives up to its name and has been incredibly reliable during my usage. I saw some disruptions a few years ago when some bad actors appeared to be specifically targeting the service, but Fastmail quickly restored service and avoided future attacks.</p>\n\n<p>The service aspect of email is kind of like your IT team: The less you think about it, the better. You expect it to just <em>work</em>. And that’s pretty much how my experience with Fastmail has been.</p>\n\n<h3>The basics</h3>\n\n<p>So what do you get when you sign up for Fastmail?</p>\n\n<p>You can check out their <a href=\"https://www.fastmail.com/pricing/\">pricing</a> page for full details, but let’s take a look at the highlights of the individual plan:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Email</li>\n<li>Calendars</li>\n<li>Contacts</li>\n<li>30GB email storage</li>\n<li>10GB file storage</li>\n<li>Connect your own domain</li>\n<li>Email aliases</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You get these awesome features (and more) for $5 a month ($60 a year).</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate that you can connect multiple domains and use multiple aliases to give yourself the appearance of unlimited email addresses. Technically, you’ll have only one email account. But the flexibility of multiple domains and aliases lets you run multiple entities or identities under one account.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, you could send and receive email from and to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"autolink\" href=\"mailto:firstname@firstnamelastname.com\">firstname@firstnamelastname.com</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"autolink\" href=\"mailto:firstname@sidehustlecompany.com\">firstname@sidehustlecompany.com</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"autolink\" href=\"mailto:troll@naughtydomain.com\">troll@naughtydomain.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But you’ll have to pay for only one account. </p>\n\n<p>Why would you use such a setup? Maybe you want to use aliases to sign up for email newsletters and lessen the damage if your contact information is compromised. (You can just delete the alias and stop receive emails to it.)</p>\n\n<p>Or maybe you want to pair these features with <a href=\"https://www.fastmail.com/blog/email-organization-filters/\">filters and rules</a> for automation purposes. Either way, you have options; what you do with those options is up to you.</p>\n\n<h2>Getting your own domain</h2>\n\n<p>You have plenty options when it comes to how you want to go about getting your own domain.</p>\n\n<p>My domain registrar of choice is <a href=\"https://www.namecheap.com/\">Namecheap</a>, mostly because they live up to their name and I’ve had no problems with them so far.</p>\n\n<p>The cost of your domain will depend on which top-level domain (TLD) you choose. Domains with the <code>.com</code> TLD are the most common and usually cost around $15 on Namecheap.</p>\n\n<p>After you’ve subscribed to Fastmail and bought your domain, you have to go through the steps of <a href=\"https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/360058753394-Custom-domains-with-Fastmail#h_01H0T77J2TVPK90BQ68TJ1T0ZT\">connecting your domain to your email</a>. Luckily, Fastmail includes instructions on how to set up a domain purchased from Namecheap, so they’ve got you covered.</p>\n\n<h2>Adding it up</h2>\n\n<p>To recap, setting up your own domain on Fastmail will cost you:</p>\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col/>\n<col/>\n</colgroup>\n\n<thead>\n<tr>\n\t<th>Service</th>\n\t<th>Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Fastmail</td>\n\t<td>$60</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Domain name</td>\n\t<td>$15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td>\n\t<td><strong>$75</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>So, for around $75 a year, you can stop worrying about whether your Gmail or Hotmail email address will look professional, and start emailing from an address you <em>know</em> will look professional. As far as I’m concerned, setting up your own domain with Fastmail is cheap and easy and shouldn’t break your marketing budget, making it a no-brainer for me.</p>\n\n## If you sign up for Fastmail\nIf you decide to pull the trigger on Fastmail, be sure to use my [affiliate link](https://join.fastmail.com/fcfbc171) for 10% off your first year of service. As expected, I'll get a little kick back, which will help pay for my own Fastmail subscription.\n\nThat sounds like a win-win to me.\n\n<p><em>Jake LaCaze loves him some Fastmail.</em></p>\n",

Otherwise, you&rsquo;re doing yourself a great disservice.</p>\n<p>You may be able to get cards for libraries beyond your local library. Some libraries in Texas participate in the <a href=\"https://www.tsl.texas.gov/texshare/card\">TexShare</a> program which gives you access to libraries across the state.</p>\n<p>Also, some libraries, like the <a href=\"https://houstonlibrary.org/mylink\">Houston Public Library</a> will give you a digital library card just for being a Texas resident.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for similar programs in other states. But these examples show why it may pay to ask or search around for similar offerings in your own state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"physical-books-and-audiobooks\">Physical books and audiobooks</h3>\n<p>When people think of their local library, they probably first think of physical books and audiobooks. And for good reason.</p>\n<p>While libraries have digital services (more on that below), they&rsquo;re still a great source for getting free access to physical reading (and listening) materials.</p>\n<h3 id=\"overdrivelibby\">OverDrive/Libby</h3>\n<p>If you prefer reading ebooks, or listening to audiobooks on your phone, then you have to see if your local library offers access to <a href=\"https://www.overdrive.com/apps\">OverDrive</a>. And if they do, also check that they offer <a href=\"https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby\">Libby</a>.</p>\n<p>With Libby, you can read ebooks directly on your phone with the app, or you can send them to your Kindle&ndash;or any device that can download the Kindle app, such as the <a href=\"https://jakelacaze.com/2023/11/30/mobiscribe-wave-bw.html\">MobiScribe Wave</a>, which can also be used to <a href=\"https://jakelacaze.com/2024/03/29/curating-my-own.html\">curate your own digital newspaper</a>. (I&rsquo;m not sure if Libby works with other strict ereader devices, such as anything by Kobo).</p>\n<p>With OverDrive and Libby, checking out books is as easy as buying them from the Kindle store. They&rsquo;re delivered straight to your device and are automatically returned after they&rsquo;ve expired.</p>\n<p>(A little birdie once told me that you can keep your ebooks beyond their expiration if you keep your device disconnected from the internet. But I can neither confirm nor deny.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"free-digital-subscriptions\">Free digital subscriptions</h3>\n<p>Libraries offer so much, it&rsquo;s hard to keep up with all of it. And so, many of their offerings go unused.</p>\n<p>Your local library may offer more digital subscriptions than you realize. For example, the Houston Public Library offers a ton of <a href=\"https://houstonlibrary.org/az/databases\">digital subscriptions</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of these subscriptions are for big-name content providers, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The New York Times</em></li>\n<li><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></li>\n<li><em>The Economist</em> via the <a href=\"https://about.pressreader.com/\">PressReader</a> app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might have to jump through some hoops like re-applying for a subscription every few days. But that&rsquo;s not the worst thing in the world, considering the price.</p>\n<h2 id=\"local-retail\">Local retail</h2>\n<p>Always be on the lookout for local retail stores, especially those that sell secondhand books.</p>\n<h3 id=\"physical-discount-store\">Physical discount store</h3>\n<p>When I was in Midland, I fell in love with the now shuttered Miss B&rsquo;s Books. You never knew what you&rsquo;d find in stock, and that was part of the fun.</p>\n<p>You can also check out places like Half Price Books, which does a great job of living up to its name. I&rsquo;m quite fond of their clearance section, where I often find something that interests me, for $3 or less.</p>\n<h3 id=\"book-sales-hosted-by-your-library-or-local-friends-of-the-public-library-chapter\">Book sales hosted by your library or local Friends of the Public Library chapter</h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been known to go a little crazy at the sales hosted by the local Friends of the Public Library chapters.</p>\n<p>These sales usually have ridiculous prices, in the line:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$2 for hardcover books</li>\n<li>$1 for paperbacks</li>\n<li>$0.50 for children&rsquo;s books</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The details will vary, but you should get the idea.</p>\n<p>Some of these books are library books removed from circulation, or they may be title donated by patrons.</p>\n<p>Also, some libraries will have &lsquo;book nooks&rsquo;, where they display some books they&rsquo;ve removed from circulation that you can get at similar prices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"online-shopping\">Online shopping</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you just can&rsquo;t find what you want in person. So you turn to the World Wide Web.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thriftbooks\">Thriftbooks</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thriftbooks.com\">ThriftBooks</a> has some ridiculous prices. I can often get books I&rsquo;m interested in for around $3 a piece. You get <a href=\"https://www.thriftbooks.com/s/free-shipping/\">free shipping</a> on domestic orders over $15.</p>\n<p>Your reading list will never be empty again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kindle-wishlist\">Kindle wishlist</h3>\n<p>Kindle ebooks can add up fast. But if you&rsquo;re patient, you can often get some great deals.</p>\n<p>When I still read on the Kindle, I filled up my Kindle wishlist and I&rsquo;d check it often. Many days, I could find an item on my wishlist on sale for $3.</p>\n<p>These deals might not be available exactly when you want them. But there&rsquo;s a good chance they&rsquo;ll come around at some point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"digital-reading\">Digital reading</h2>\n<p>Books aren&rsquo;t the only place to find great reading material.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rss\">RSS</h3>\n<p>Everyone should be using RSS to combat the unwanted effects of <a href=\"https://jakelacaze.com/2023/01/10/social-media-engagement.html\">social media engagement algorithms</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out the video below if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with RSS.</p>\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HNUqDL-pI8\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>You can use RSS for free by saving your feeds locally. I like to use an RSS service that will save my feeds, just in case I blow up my computer, as I&rsquo;m known to do. For a third-party RSS service, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with <a href=\"https://miniflux.app/\">Miniflux</a> or <a href=\"https://newsblur.com\">NewsBlur</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"read-it-later-services\">Read-it-later services</h3>\n<p>If you use RSS, you&rsquo;re likely going to want to pair it with a read-it-later service. These services are where you save articles you&rsquo;re interested in but don&rsquo;t have the time to read right now. You <em>could</em> leave these articles in your RSS reader. But sending them to a read-it-later service makes managing your digital to-read list easier. And you can use your read-it-later service to keep up with articles you found outside your RSS feeds.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re likely already familiar with read-it-later services like Pocket or Instapaper. But if you want a great free read-it-later option, then you should check out <a href=\"https://omnivore.app\">Omnivore</a>. As an added bonus, you can use Omnivore to sync article highlights and notes to your <a href=\"https://jakelacaze.com/2024/05/17/idea-capture-systems.html\">personal knowledge management</a> app, such as <a href=\"https://logseq.com\">Logseq</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-to-reading\">Get to reading</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about reading more, you now have no excuse.

And if they do, also check that they offer [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby).\n\nWith Libby, you can read ebooks directly on your phone with the app, or you can send them to your Kindle--or any device that can download the Kindle app, such as the [MobiScribe Wave](https://jakelacaze.com/2023/11/30/mobiscribe-wave-bw.html), which can also be used to [curate your own digital newspaper](https://jakelacaze.com/2024/03/29/curating-my-own.html). (I'm not sure if Libby works with other strict ereader devices, such as anything by Kobo).\n\nWith OverDrive and Libby, checking out books is as easy as buying them from the Kindle store. They're delivered straight to your device and are automatically returned after they've expired.\n\n(A little birdie once told me that you can keep your ebooks beyond their expiration if you keep your device disconnected from the internet. But I can neither confirm nor deny.)\n\n### Free digital subscriptions\nLibraries offer so much, it's hard to keep up with all of it. And so, many of their offerings go unused.\n\nYour local library may offer more digital subscriptions than you realize. For example, the Houston Public Library offers a ton of [digital subscriptions](https://houstonlibrary.org/az/databases).\n\nMany of these subscriptions are for big-name content providers, such as:\n\n- *The New York Times*\n- *The Wall Street Journal*\n- *The Economist* via the [PressReader](https://about.pressreader.com/) app.\n\nYou might have to jump through some hoops like re-applying for a subscription every few days. But that's not the worst thing in the world, considering the price.\n \n## Local retail\nAlways be on the lookout for local retail stores, especially those that sell secondhand books.\n\n### Physical discount store\nWhen I was in Midland, I fell in love with the now shuttered Miss B's Books. You never knew what you'd find in stock, and that was part of the fun.\n\nYou can also check out places like Half Price Books, which does a great job of living up to its name. I'm quite fond of their clearance section, where I often find something that interests me, for $3 or less.\n\n### Book sales hosted by your library or local Friends of the Public Library chapter\nI've been known to go a little crazy at the sales hosted by the local Friends of the Public Library chapters.\n\nThese sales usually have ridiculous prices, in the line:\n\n- $2 for hardcover books\n- $1 for paperbacks\n- $0.50 for children's books\n\nThe details will vary, but you should get the idea.\n\nSome of these books are library books removed from circulation, or they may be title donated by patrons. \n\nAlso, some libraries will have 'book nooks', where they display some books they've removed from circulation that you can get at similar prices.\n\n## Online shopping\nSometimes you just can't find what you want in person. So you turn to the World Wide Web.\n\n### Thriftbooks\n[ThriftBooks](https://www.thriftbooks.com) has some ridiculous prices. I can often get books I'm interested in for around $3 a piece. You get [free shipping](https://www.thriftbooks.com/s/free-shipping/) on domestic orders over $15.\n\nYour reading list will never be empty again.\n\n### Kindle wishlist\nKindle ebooks can add up fast. But if you're patient, you can often get some great deals.\n\nWhen I still read on the Kindle, I filled up my Kindle wishlist and I'd check it often. Many days, I could find an item on my wishlist on sale for $3. \n\nThese deals might not be available exactly when you want them. But there's a good chance they'll come around at some point.\n\n## Digital reading\nBooks aren't the only place to find great reading material. \n\n### RSS\nEveryone should be using RSS to combat the unwanted effects of [social media engagement algorithms](https://jakelacaze.com/2023/01/10/social-media-engagement.html).\n\nCheck out the video below if you're unfamiliar with RSS.\n\n{{< youtube 6HNUqDL-pI8 >}}\n\nYou can use RSS for free by saving your feeds locally. I like to use an RSS service that will save my feeds, just in case I blow up my computer, as I'm known to do. For a third-party RSS service, you can't go wrong with [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) or [NewsBlur](https://newsblur.com).\n\n### Read-it-later services\nIf you use RSS, you're likely going to want to pair it with a read-it-later service. These services are where you save articles you're interested in but don't have the time to read right now. You *could* leave these articles in your RSS reader. But sending them to a read-it-later service makes managing your digital to-read list easier. And you can use your read-it-later service to keep up with articles you found outside your RSS feeds.\n\nYou're likely already familiar with read-it-later services like Pocket or Instapaper. But if you want a great free read-it-later option, then you should check out [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app). As an added bonus, you can use Omnivore to sync article highlights and notes to your [personal knowledge management](https://jakelacaze.com/2024/05/17/idea-capture-systems.html) app, such as [Logseq](https://logseq.com).\n\n## Get to reading\nIf you're serious about reading more, you now have no excuse. So start filling that idea machine with fuel.\n\n*Jake LaCaze just exposed himself as a total nerd.*\n",

But you can reduce some of the pain of switching by learning how to back up and restore your ```Home``` folder using [rsync](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-rsync-to-sync-local-and-remote-directories). \n\nIn life in general, the loudest voices are often the ones you should listen to least. The wisest voices are often harder to find. The Linux world is no different. In fact, perhaps the Linux world is the worst example of this universal truth.\n\nFortunately, cooler heads can be found, even in the Linux world:\n\n{{< youtube 34DIO61GxAE >}}\n\nAs I've already said, what's great about Linux is what's bad about it. But let's focus on the positive side. Linux offers an abundance of choice. That means how I Linux is not how you have to Linux.\n\nYou can Linux your own way.\n\n*Jake LaCaze is on a quest to remind the world that things are far more grey than we are led to believe.*\n\n---\n\n#### Songspiration\nThe song that, at least in part, influenced this post:\n\n{{< youtube DubafeFeJ7Y >}}\n\n---\n\n#### Other news\nIn my constant quest to expand my skill set, I'm looking at how I can position myself for jobs in the oil and gas/energy technology sectors.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to [contact](/contact) me if you have any ideas.\n\nNamaste.\n\n",

				"content_text": "In so many ways, the internet sucks.\n\nSocial media engagement algorithms have made it even harder to find quality content worthy of our attention[^algorithms]. These algorithms don't push stories *you* care about. They instead push stories other people care about in the hopes that you'll fit into the same bucket as other consumers. They provide access to an abundance of content, but the content is often, quite frankly, *crap*. (Feel free to substitute a stronger word if you like.)\n\nUnfortunately, the only answer I've found for these algorithms requires some work. We must take ownership of our own digital experience and curate the content we want to see. We can't afford to rely on the machines to inform or entertain us.\n\nLately, I've started using my MobiScribe Wave[^wave] as my own digital newspaper. Though the Wave is firstly an e-ink writing tablet, I appreciate that I can read and annotate interesting articles directly on a device I often keep at my side.\n\nThe rest of this post will give some insight into the tools and setup that help me curate my own digital newspaper.

But now we can argue it’s one of the best values on the whole of the internet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>micro.blog Premium features include</strong> but are not limited to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Blog hosting.</li>\n<li>Podcast feed.</li>\n<li>Email newsletters.</li>\n<li>Cross-posting to select social networks.</li>\n<li>A built-in network of other bloggers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now multiply that times <strong>five</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>But not the price. The price stays the same at $10 a month<sup><a href=\"#fn2-1277\" id=\"fnr2-1277\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>. Pretty awesome.</p>\n\n<h2>The value in what micro.blog does NOT offer</h2>\n\n<p>micro.blog is a unique platform in that what it doesn’t offer may be just as valuable as what it does offer.</p>\n\n<p>Below are <strong>some things intentionally missing from micro.blog</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Social media engagement algorithms<sup><a href=\"#fn2-1277\" id=\"fnr1-1277\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>.</p></li>\n<li>Likes</li>\n<li>Follower counts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Social media engagement algorithms have made it hard to keep up with content and sources we really care about. Likes and follower counts have skewed our perception of what’s worth sharing.</p>\n\n<p>But you won’t find these features (or bugs?) on micro.blog. You can follow other users, but they won’t really know unless you tell them. The same goes for any of their posts you <em>like</em>—you’ll have to actually tell them you like their posts, in your own words. The act takes a little bit of work, but it really goes a long way.</p>\n\n<h2>micro.blog is an awesome slice of the internet</h2>\n\n<p>With micro.blog, your personal domain is your home on the internet. And with generous pricing, they’re giving users more reason to upgrade to Premium.</p>\n\n<p class=\"note\"><em>Jake LaCaze loves praising tech companies for doing things right.

Whatever your industry, you’re in business to serve your customers or clients. If you’re not doing that, then why the hell should you expect to stay in business? Why should anyone continue to give you their money if they’re not really getting anything back in return?</p>\n\n<p>The SaaShole is a mindset. Despite its specific name, the SaaShole mindset doesn’t apply only to those in SaaS. It applies to tech all the way up and down the industry.</p>\n\n<p>Often, tech companies are selling tech solutions to non-tech people—people who don’t identify as working in <em>the tech industry</em>. So tech bros (and sisses) are often better off assuming their customers know little about tech beyond how to check their email on their smartphone, because these customers aren’t concerned about the tech—they’re concerned about solving an issue and completing a task that they don’t view through the lens of technology. If tech can help them, great—they’re all for the help. </p>\n\n<p>But for them, tech is a means to an end, not the end itself. (The good news is that if you’re wrong in assuming that your customers know next to nothing about tech, you can always deepen the technical explanations to meet them where they are. Starting with the default assumption your customers don’t know much about tech and then ramping up seems a better strategy than bombarding them with more they can handle and then trying to bring it down to their level.)</p>\n\n<p>I’ve previously written about how I think tech suffers from a lack of philosophy beyond ‘Move fast and break things’<sup><a href=\"#fn4-24053\" id=\"fnr4-24053\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">4</a></sup>.

				"content_text": "<p>This post is not a straight-up ‘MobiScribe Wave vs. Kindle Scribe’ kind of post because I can’t compare the devices themselves. As I said in my MobiScribe perspective post <sup><a href=\"#fn1-21982\" id=\"fnr1-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, I’ve only demoed the Kindle Scribe at my local Best Buy. But, as someone who’s used numerous Kindle e-ink readers over the years, I can speak to the advantages of the MobiScribe Wave over the Kindle ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>And with that said, let’s get to it.</p>\n\n<h2>The limitations of the Kindle ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p>With the Kindle Scribe—like any other Kindle e-ink device—you are not buying a device that opens the door to other platforms; you are instead buying into a limited ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>Out of the box (and hacking solutions aside), you can’t download other apps for reading content outside of purchases made directly from Kindle. </p>\n\n<p>Apple often gets flak for the walled garden aspects of its own ecosystem, especially on iPhone and iPad devices. But to Apple’s credit, at least they do let you download apps outside their ecosystem, though to be fair, those same apps may not be the easiest to use, as is the case with apps that can sync to Apple’s mobile devices only via iCloud. (Obsidian comes to mind<sup><a href=\"#fn2-21982\" id=\"fnr2-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>. To sync Obsidian with mobile devices, you have only two options: iCloud and Obsidian Sync. At a cost of $8 per month, Obsidian Sync isn’t a great alternative for everyone.) The point is that Apple’s ecosystem has its issues, but it’s nothing compared to Kindle’s.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of apps and functionality, if you go with the Kindle Scribe, you better be completely satisfied with the Kindle ecosystem because the Kindle e-ink devices are basically gateways <em>only</em> to Amazon content. By default—again assuming you haven’t hacked the device—all your content comes from the Kindle Store. You do have the option to transfer ebooks from your computer, which would most likely require stripping the DRM, unless you got the books already DRM-free. But most normies aren’t going to go that route.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Fortunately, you can still save money on ebooks via the Kindle if your library offers access to the Libby app<sup><a href=\"#fn3-21982\" id=\"fnr3-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>. </p>\n\n<h2>The flexibility of the MobiScribe ecosystem—or lack thereof</h2>\n\n<p>Android tablets, including the MobiScribe Wave, give you plenty options for downloading other apps for reading various written content. </p>\n\n<p>With the Wave, as is the case with other Android tablets, the Kindle Store is simply another option. The device comes with the option to easily download the Kindle app via the MobiStore. But you can also enable Google Play and download other apps, which may save you some money. </p>\n\n<p>As a personal example, I recently figured out how to read current issues of <em>The Economist</em> via the Houston Public Library <sup><a href=\"#fn4-21982\" id=\"fnr4-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> and the PressReader<sup><a href=\"#fn5-21982\" id=\"fnr5-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> app available from Google Play, saving me over $200 a year. With the Kindle, I can read ebooks and publications only if I can purchase or subscribe to them via the Kindle store. Because <em>The Economist</em> recently cut off access via the Kindle store, I have no option to read the magazine on the Kindle, no matter how much I’m willing to pay.</p>\n\n<p>The Wave also lets me download RSS apps and read-it latter apps so that I can keep up with my digital sources, if I so choose.

				"content_html": "<p><em>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s ahead for tech in 2024. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I won&rsquo;t be thinking about it.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>A career in the volatile oil and gas industry has cured me of any thoughts on making bold predictions. So instead I’ll look at what may happen (instead of what I think will happen) and what I’d like to happen for tech in 2024.</p>\n<h2 id=\"will-the-generative-ai-bubble-burst\">Will the generative AI bubble burst?</h2>\n<p>It’s too hard to say if the generative AI bubble will burst in 2024. But I certainly hope it will. My reasons have been well-documented on this site. For one, I fear the developers of generative AI are too busy trying to sell their non-human-focused solutions rather than solving problems that could help real people<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>If a career in oil and gas has taught me one thing, it’s that ‘boom’ is often another word for ‘bubble.’ And bubbles burst eventually. 2023 brought a great boom for generative AI. Might 2024 bring the bust?</p>\n<p>Fingers crossed.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say the bubble does burst. <em>What follows?</em></p>\n<p>What will the shakeout look like? What developments will stick around?</p>\n<p>The internet didn&rsquo;t go away when the dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s. The internet itself wasn&rsquo;t a total waste; there was just a lot of fat that needed to be trimmed so that we could focus on the useful parts.</p>\n<p>The same logic applies to AI.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of us can get behind the thought of AI having an impact beyond the burst of the bubble. But as Chuck Klosterman pointed out in <em>But What If We&rsquo;re Wrong?</em><sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>, we run into problems when we try to get more specific with such prediction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-2024-the-year-to-regain-control-of-your-digital-home\">Is 2024 the year to regain control of your digital home?</h2>\n<p>With the rise of social media, personal homepages became less important.</p>\n<p>But now with the chaos of Twitter/X, many people are re-thinking their stances on owning their digital home spaces. Many of those same people don’t want to trade one dumpster fire for another by leaning on Meta-owned platforms. So they&rsquo;re looking for niche, sometimes indie, solutions.</p>\n<p>Many are opting to invest in homepages again.</p>\n<p>I spent the last quarter of 2023 setting up my own digital home at jakelacaze.com. 2024 is the year I’ll settle in and hopefully more consistently blog (and maybe include other types of content).</p>\n<p>I don’t know if I’ll ever abandon social media. LinkedIn helps with finding new jobs. And experimenting with platforms like Bluesky adds variety to the online experience. But I know my own webpage should remain my digital focus and that I should use other tools only insofar as they don’t distract me from my own platform.</p>\n<p>I hope more people will join along so that we can make the web weird&ndash;and therefore, <em>fun</em>&ndash;again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"could-logseq-be-a-useful-personal-knowledge-management-system\">Could Logseq be a useful personal knowledge management system?</h2>\n<p>I’ve given Obsidian many tries over the years, but for some reason, it never quite stuck for me.</p>\n<p>In December I tried Logseq and am so far loving it<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Logseq and Obsidian largely do the same thing: They both act as a ‘second brain’ where you can dump information so that you can use your limited brain power on the hard stuff.</p>\n<p>While Obsidian is designed around individual pages, Logseq instead focuses on bullet points.

				"content_text": "\n*I don't know what's ahead for tech in 2024. But that doesn't mean I won't be thinking about it.*\n\n---\n\nA career in the volatile oil and gas industry has cured me of any thoughts on making bold predictions. So instead I’ll look at what may happen (instead of what I think will happen) and what I’d like to happen for tech in 2024.\n\n## Will the generative AI bubble burst?\nIt’s too hard to say if the generative AI bubble will burst in 2024. But I certainly hope it will. My reasons have been well-documented on this site. For one, I fear the developers of generative AI are too busy trying to sell their non-human-focused solutions rather than solving problems that could help real people[^aibubble].\n\nIf a career in oil and gas has taught me one thing, it’s that ‘boom’ is often another word for ‘bubble.’ And bubbles burst eventually. 2023 brought a great boom for generative AI. Might 2024 bring the bust?\n\nFingers crossed.\n\nLet's say the bubble does burst. *What follows?*\n\nWhat will the shakeout look like? What developments will stick around?\n\nThe internet didn't go away when the dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s. The internet itself wasn't a total waste; there was just a lot of fat that needed to be trimmed so that we could focus on the useful parts.\n\nThe same logic applies to AI.\n\nI'm sure many of us can get behind the thought of AI having an impact beyond the burst of the bubble. But as Chuck Klosterman pointed out in *But What If We're Wrong?*[^klosterman], we run into problems when we try to get more specific with such prediction.\n\n## Is 2024 the year to regain control of your digital home?\nWith the rise of social media, personal homepages became less important.\n\nBut now with the chaos of Twitter/X, many people are re-thinking their stances on owning their digital home spaces. Many of those same people don’t want to trade one dumpster fire for another by leaning on Meta-owned platforms. So they're looking for niche, sometimes indie, solutions.\n\nMany are opting to invest in homepages again.\n\nI spent the last quarter of 2023 setting up my own digital home at jakelacaze.com. 2024 is the year I’ll settle in and hopefully more consistently blog (and maybe include other types of content).\n\nI don’t know if I’ll ever abandon social media. LinkedIn helps with finding new jobs. And experimenting with platforms like Bluesky adds variety to the online experience. But I know my own webpage should remain my digital focus and that I should use other tools only insofar as they don’t distract me from my own platform.\n\nI hope more people will join along so that we can make the web weird--and therefore, *fun*--again.\n\n## Could Logseq be a useful personal knowledge management system?\nI’ve given Obsidian many tries over the years, but for some reason, it never quite stuck for me.\n\nIn December I tried Logseq and am so far loving it[^logseq]. \n\nLogseq and Obsidian largely do the same thing: They both act as a ‘second brain’ where you can dump information so that you can use your limited brain power on the hard stuff.\n\nWhile Obsidian is designed around individual pages, Logseq instead focuses on bullet points. Perhaps because I once tried the bullet journal method[^bujo], thinking and organising information in terms of bullet points makes sense to me.\n\nI hope Logseq can prove to be a tool worth the time.\n\n## Here's to hoping you find a way to make tech work for you in 2024\nThe tech industry has a habit of making us bend to the tech they build.\n\nI urge you to instead look at how you can bend tech to work around you. Maybe that requires rethinking how you use tech. Maybe it requires simplifying usage. Or maybe you've already got everything perfectly figured out.\n\nEither way, I see little harm in our being more thoughtful about the digital tools we use on a daily basis.\n\n<p class=\"note\">\n<em>Jake LaCaze wishes you a happy near year in tech and beyond.</em>\n</p>\n\n[^aibubble]: [Is AI just a solution looking for a problem?](/blog/is-ai-just-a-solution-looking-for-a-problem/) on jakelacaze.com\n[^logseq]: [Logseq](https://logseq.com)\n[^bujo]: [How to Bullet Journal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM) on YouTube\n[^klosterman]: {{< bookshop 9780399184130 >}} <em>But What If We're Wrong?</em> by Chuck Klosterman{{< /bookshop >}} on Bookshop.org (Affiliate link)\n",

If I’d gone that route, I most likely would have bought a keyboard case to go with it, likely pushing me past $300 total.</p>\n<p>I could have come up with the money for something I truly <em>needed</em>. But this was more of a toy purchase. I had some money burning a hole in my pocket after I sold my Nintendo 2DS, so I was happy to pull the trigger if I could basically break even. But I didn&rsquo;t want to spend much more than what I&rsquo;d made by letting go of a device I rarely used.</p>\n<p>So let&rsquo;s see what I got.</p>\n<h2 id=\"loose-specs\">Loose specs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>MacBook Air 5,2 (2012 model)</li>\n<li>4GB RAM</li>\n<li>128 GB SSD</li>\n<li>1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 2.8GHz)</li>\n<li>USB 3.0 (x2)</li>\n<li>MagSafe charger</li>\n<li>SD card reader</li>\n<li>Headphone jack</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It ain’t got the shiniest features, but it’s got most (if not all) I need.</p>\n<p>Many newer computers save space by abandoning USB 3.0 ports and using only USB-C ports.

(And I wish the seller had disclosed that it needed replacing.) But I found a replacement battery for ~$30 on eBay. Replacing the battery was a breeze and probably took about 15 minutes. So all in all, not too shabby.</p>\n<p>I seem to be getting around three hours of battery life between charges. That sounds weak when compared to newer laptops that routinely get well over 10 hours of battery life. But it&rsquo;s way better than what I was getting with the old battery (I might have been lucky to have gotten an hour).</p>\n<p>But I&rsquo;m rarely in a situation in which I absolutely must go more than three hours without charging. And if I&rsquo;m in such a situation, keeping my computer running is probably not high on my list of priorities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"keyboard\">Keyboard</h3>\n<p>When people talk about old MacBooks, they often want to know whether the keyboard features butterfly switches or scissor switches. But when it comes to this keyboard, I instead find myself thinking about how I overlooked the fact that this keyboard doesn’t feature the standard American layout.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I bought some keyboard stickers for ~$6 on Amazon to help me out. And I’m adjusting to the small, oddly-shaped Enter key.</p>\n<p>It’s not perfect, but it’s nothing I can’t adapt to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-about-that-outdated-macos\">What about that outdated MacOS?</h2>\n<p>This MacBook Air is officially supported only up to MacOS 10.15.7 (Catalina), which received its last update back in July 2022.</p>\n<p>For a while, I experimented with a few flavours of Linux. Solus OS was beautiful and smooth. But I got tired of dealing with the usual Linux issues. Certain apps aren’t available. I thought I could overcome the lack of iCloud support with the help of Syncthing, but every file change seemed to bring a wave of sync conflicts. I don’t want to put a ton of work into making Linux work for me on my personal desktop. I instead want to focus on writing and creating.</p>\n<p>So I settled on MacOS. Thanks to OpenCore Legacy Patcher, I was able to update to MacOS 12.7.2 (Monterey)<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. I could have tried upgrading to Sonoma, but I decided to hold back to the oldest officially updated MacOS because this laptop has only 4GB RAM.</p>\n<p>I’m quite impressed with the ease of installing an unsupported OS with OpenCore Legacy. So far, I have no issues to report. And it’s breathing new life into a perfectly capable device that Apple deems no longer worth updating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-usable-will-this-macbook-air-be-in-2024-and-beyond\">How usable will this MacBook Air be in 2024 and beyond?</h2>\n<p>This laptop has some limitations, perhaps most notably the 4GB RAM.</p>\n<p>4GB RAM may be fine for a Chromebook, but for most other computers, you really want at least 8GB. But if I’m honest about my needs, I could likely get by on 4GB RAM for a while yet.</p>\n<p>The duo-core CPU is also a bit of a concern.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the RAM is soldered, so I can’t replace it. And replacing a CPU on a laptop is often equally hopeless. So I’m stuck with these limitations as long as I keep the laptop.</p>\n<p>The good news is that I’d wager I spend 80% of my computer time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading RSS feeds.</li>\n<li>Checking email.</li>\n<li>Watching YouTube videos.</li>\n<li>Writing.</li>\n<li>Basic photo editing (resizing and cropping).</li>\n<li>Updating my website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So it’s not as if I need a beast of a machine for my daily use. Sure, it’d be nice to have more power. But I think I’ll get by just fine. If I do need a more capable computer, I’m lucky to have a newer Mac mini available.</p>\n<p>I expect this laptop to serve me well as a secondary mobile machine for at least a couple extra years, at which point maybe I’ll replace it with a machine from 2015. Maybe 2016 if I really feel like splurging.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p><a href=\"https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/\">OpenCore Legacy Patcher</a>&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

So all in all, not too shabby.\n\nI seem to be getting around three hours of battery life between charges. That sounds weak when compared to newer laptops that routinely get well over 10 hours of battery life. But it's way better than what I was getting with the old battery (I might have been lucky to have gotten an hour).\n\nBut I'm rarely in a situation in which I absolutely must go more than three hours without charging. And if I'm in such a situation, keeping my computer running is probably not high on my list of priorities.\n\n### Keyboard\nWhen people talk about old MacBooks, they often want to know whether the keyboard features butterfly switches or scissor switches. But when it comes to this keyboard, I instead find myself thinking about how I overlooked the fact that this keyboard doesn’t feature the standard American layout. \n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"uploads/2024/e759303d6b.jpg\" alt=\"A picture of a 2012 MacBook Air with a non-American keyboard\">\n<figcaption>2012 MacBook Air with a non-America keyboard - Picture from original eBay listing</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI bought some keyboard stickers for ~$6 on Amazon to help me out. And I’m adjusting to the small, oddly-shaped Enter key.\n\nIt’s not perfect, but it’s nothing I can’t adapt to.\n\n## What about that outdated MacOS?\nThis MacBook Air is officially supported only up to MacOS 10.15.7 (Catalina), which received its last update back in July 2022.\n\nFor a while, I experimented with a few flavours of Linux. Solus OS was beautiful and smooth. But I got tired of dealing with the usual Linux issues. Certain apps aren’t available. I thought I could overcome the lack of iCloud support with the help of Syncthing, but every file change seemed to bring a wave of sync conflicts. I don’t want to put a ton of work into making Linux work for me on my personal desktop. I instead want to focus on writing and creating.\n\nSo I settled on MacOS. Thanks to OpenCore Legacy Patcher, I was able to update to MacOS 12.7.2 (Monterey)[^opencore]. I could have tried upgrading to Sonoma, but I decided to hold back to the oldest officially updated MacOS because this laptop has only 4GB RAM.\n\nI’m quite impressed with the ease of installing an unsupported OS with OpenCore Legacy. So far, I have no issues to report. And it’s breathing new life into a perfectly capable device that Apple deems no longer worth updating.\n\n## How usable will this MacBook Air be in 2024 and beyond?\nThis laptop has some limitations, perhaps most notably the 4GB RAM. \n\n4GB RAM may be fine for a Chromebook, but for most other computers, you really want at least 8GB. But if I’m honest about my needs, I could likely get by on 4GB RAM for a while yet. \n\nThe duo-core CPU is also a bit of a concern.\n\nUnfortunately, the RAM is soldered, so I can’t replace it. And replacing a CPU on a laptop is often equally hopeless. So I’m stuck with these limitations as long as I keep the laptop.\n\nThe good news is that I’d wager I spend 80% of my computer time:\n- Reading RSS feeds.\n- Checking email.\n- Watching YouTube videos.\n- Writing.\n- Basic photo editing (resizing and cropping).\n- Updating my website.\n\nSo it’s not as if I need a beast of a machine for my daily use. Sure, it’d be nice to have more power. But I think I’ll get by just fine. If I do need a more capable computer, I’m lucky to have a newer Mac mini available.\n\nI expect this laptop to serve me well as a secondary mobile machine for at least a couple extra years, at which point maybe I’ll replace it with a machine from 2015. Maybe 2016 if I really feel like splurging.\n\n<p class=\"note\">\n<em>Jake LaCaze really likes the idea of thrifting as he gets older.</em>\n</p>\n\n[^opencore]: [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/)\n",

But we feel as if we must, so we don't contribute to the community.\n\nAnd then there are the issues of the look and feel of the internet.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/289d8a3e39.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Bluesky describing the state of the internet in 2023\">\n<figcaption>The state of the internet in 2023 according to Kyle Marquis on Bluesky - <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/moochava.bsky.social/post/3kezblechme2f\">Link to original post</a>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe internet is now highly centralized, dominated by four of five major players. Any new platform that gains attention risks being acquired by one of the majors and maybe abandoned or shut down. And most sites sites not owned by the big players are plastered in ads and popups and autoplay videos, making the content you came for inaccessible, particularly on mobile.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/bcbb19fa98.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of a recipe website with a video on top of a signup popup\">\n<figcaption>A video on top of a signup popup on a mobile site—This is the hell Kyle Marquis was warning us about.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe modern internet has been optimized--not for users, but for corporations. And as the great poet Cyndi Lauper warned us four decades ago, money changes everything.[^lauper]\n\nAnything that gains a major following online and sticks around will most likely be monetized at some point, as it deserves to be. Maintaining these sites and services isn't free. So, is this just the fate of the internet for the most part? Was the era of fun a brief window in the late '90s and early 2000s? Is it gone forever?\n\n<p class=\"note\"><em>Jake LaCaze wants the internet to be fun again.</em></p>\n\n[^1]: [Why the Internet Isn't Fun Anymore](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/why-the-internet-isnt-fun-anymore)\n[^lauper]: ['Money Changes Everything'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ffc0TCGIG4) by Cyndi Lauper (YouTube)\n[^lynch]: [Marshawn Lynch: 'I'm just here so I won't get fined'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1kvwXsZtU8) (YouTube)\n[^algorithms]: [Social media engagement algorithms and the illusion of choice](https://jakelacaze.com/2023/01/10/social-media-engagement.html) on jakelacaze.com\n",

				"title": "MobiScribe Wave B\u0026W - More perspective than review",
				"content_html": "<p><em>The MobiScribe Wave isn&rsquo;t the best e-ink device out there. But it might be all you need.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Over the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with the MobiScribe Wave. Because the device is an interesting mix of value and compromises, you should do your research before you buy.</p>\n<p>This post is less technical than you&rsquo;ll find on most other reviews. I hope to instead give practical perspective to inform your buying decision. The MobiScribe Wave is not a premium device in the same class as the Remarkable 2, Kindle Scribe, or Ratta Supernote. But depending on your usage, the Wave may be all you need.</p>\n<p>While using the Wave as my main writing and reading device for the last month or so, I&rsquo;ve become well-acquainted with its limitations. But I still love the device despite its flaws.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-i-bought-the-mobiscribe-wave\">Why I bought the MobiScribe Wave</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;d had my eye on an e-ink writing tablet for a while now. But at times I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling I wanted one only because I wanted a new toy, and that buying such a device would be a waste of money.</p>\n<p>Comparable e-ink writing tablets from MobiScribe&rsquo;s competitors are significantly more expensive than the Wave&ndash;some over twice as much, depending on what specs and accessories you get.</p>\n<p>Later in this post you&rsquo;ll find a brief comparisons of the Wave and its competitors; hopefully then you&rsquo;ll understand why I was reluctant to splurge on a device I wasn&rsquo;t sure was truly for me. I was tempted to stick with old fashioned pen and paper. But the old ways weren&rsquo;t working out great on my morning and evening train commutes.</p>\n<p>With physical notebooks, I struggle with keeping different types of writing separate in their own notebooks. But it&rsquo;s often more convenient to carry only one notebook. With the MobiScribe Wave, I can now have the best of both scenarios, at a great price.</p>\n<p>With an e-ink notebook, I can switch between reading and writing in a snap, within the same device. And reading my writing partner&rsquo;s stories on my Wave is way easier than reading them on my tiny phone screen (iPhone SE). Also, on my phone, it&rsquo;s too easy to find something else to do with so many apps at my fingertips. So, for a while, I was printing my writing partner&rsquo;s stories out. Making notes on an 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; piece of paper is inconvenient at the best of times on the train, but even more so on those days where it&rsquo;s standing room only.</p>\n<p>Having everything I need on one device cuts down on the number of items I carry in my laptop bag. Each book, notebook, pen, pencil, eraser, etc., adds weight and bulk. Maybe I&rsquo;d feel differently if I got to call my own shots and could work when and where I wanted. But I instead sold my soul to The Man, so the MobiScribe Wave is a great device for me.</p>\n<p>I resisted the urge to buy an e-ink writing tablet for a while. But when Cal Newport kept singing the praises of his Remarkable 2 on the Deep Questions Podcast<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, I could no longer resist. And a certain YouTube video from Voja of My Deep Guide<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> convinced me the Wave was worth taking a chance on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-you-get\">What you get</h2>\n<p>Below is <strong>what you receive when you buy the MobiScribe Wave:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The MobiScribe Wave e-ink notebook.</li>\n<li>MobiScribe&rsquo;s standard Stylus.</li>\n<li>Cover for the device.</li>\n<li>USB-C cable for charging and file transfer (wall plug not included).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-primary-device\">The primary device</h3>\n<p>The primary device feels solid.</p>\n<p>The back has indentions on the side which make it easy to hold.</p>\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d like having a recessed screen, especially because I&rsquo;d gotten used to a flush screen on my Kindle Oasis (before my wife decided she wanted to start reading again and basically stole my Oasis, thereby justifying my purchase of the Wave). But I&rsquo;m happy to report the recessed screen hasn&rsquo;t been an issue. In fact, I&rsquo;ve forgotten it&rsquo;s even an aspect of the device.</p>\n<p>64GB of storage is very generous at this price point. More expensive devices come with much less storage.</p>\n<p>The front light is one of those features that most e-reader fans likely take for granted.

				"content_text": "\n*The MobiScribe Wave isn't the best e-ink device out there. But it might be all you need.*\n\n---\n\nOver the last few weeks, I've fallen in love with the MobiScribe Wave. Because the device is an interesting mix of value and compromises, you should do your research before you buy. \n\nThis post is less technical than you'll find on most other reviews. I hope to instead give practical perspective to inform your buying decision. The MobiScribe Wave is not a premium device in the same class as the Remarkable 2, Kindle Scribe, or Ratta Supernote. But depending on your usage, the Wave may be all you need.\n\nWhile using the Wave as my main writing and reading device for the last month or so, I've become well-acquainted with its limitations. But I still love the device despite its flaws.\n\n## Why I bought the MobiScribe Wave\nI'd had my eye on an e-ink writing tablet for a while now. But at times I couldn't help feeling I wanted one only because I wanted a new toy, and that buying such a device would be a waste of money. \n\nComparable e-ink writing tablets from MobiScribe's competitors are significantly more expensive than the Wave--some over twice as much, depending on what specs and accessories you get. \n\nLater in this post you'll find a brief comparisons of the Wave and its competitors; hopefully then you'll understand why I was reluctant to splurge on a device I wasn't sure was truly for me. I was tempted to stick with old fashioned pen and paper. But the old ways weren't working out great on my morning and evening train commutes.\n\nWith physical notebooks, I struggle with keeping different types of writing separate in their own notebooks. But it's often more convenient to carry only one notebook. With the MobiScribe Wave, I can now have the best of both scenarios, at a great price. \n\nWith an e-ink notebook, I can switch between reading and writing in a snap, within the same device. And reading my writing partner's stories on my Wave is way easier than reading them on my tiny phone screen (iPhone SE). Also, on my phone, it's too easy to find something else to do with so many apps at my fingertips. So, for a while, I was printing my writing partner's stories out. Making notes on an 8.5\" x 11\" piece of paper is inconvenient at the best of times on the train, but even more so on those days where it's standing room only.\n\nHaving everything I need on one device cuts down on the number of items I carry in my laptop bag. Each book, notebook, pen, pencil, eraser, etc., adds weight and bulk. Maybe I'd feel differently if I got to call my own shots and could work when and where I wanted. But I instead sold my soul to The Man, so the MobiScribe Wave is a great device for me.\n\nI resisted the urge to buy an e-ink writing tablet for a while. But when Cal Newport kept singing the praises of his Remarkable 2 on the Deep Questions Podcast[^cal], I could no longer resist. And a certain YouTube video from Voja of My Deep Guide[^voja] convinced me the Wave was worth taking a chance on.\n\n## What you get\nBelow is **what you receive when you buy the MobiScribe Wave:**\n- The MobiScribe Wave e-ink notebook.\n- MobiScribe's standard Stylus.\n- Cover for the device.\n- USB-C cable for charging and file transfer (wall plug not included). \n\n### The primary device\nThe primary device feels solid. \n\nThe back has indentions on the side which make it easy to hold. \n\nI wasn't sure I'd like having a recessed screen, especially because I'd gotten used to a flush screen on my Kindle Oasis (before my wife decided she wanted to start reading again and basically stole my Oasis, thereby justifying my purchase of the Wave). But I'm happy to report the recessed screen hasn't been an issue. In fact, I've forgotten it's even an aspect of the device.\n\n64GB of storage is very generous at this price point. More expensive devices come with much less storage.\n\nThe front light is one of those features that most e-reader fans likely take for granted. But, when you consider that no versions of the Remarkable 2 include a front light, you realize what a luxury it is.\n\n### Stylus\nThe stylus is fine. \n\nFrom what I've read online, the stylus doesn't give as much feedback as the Remarkable 2's stylus, which may be an issue for some users. The good news is that the Wave is compatiable with most styluses that use Wacom EMR technology, so you can switch out for a better stylus if you like.\n\nHaving an eraser on the end of the stylus is nice. But I can't help wanting to rub when I erase--like you'd expect to do with a pencil eraser--and I'm pretty sure that's how I scratched my screen. The scratches aren't bad and I don't find them distracting. But it's disappointing that I'm already seeing cosmetic wear and tear after only a month of ownership.\n\nI replaced the nib after three weeks of usage. I haven't had the device long enough to know if this will be the average lifespan for my nibs. Also, your mileage may vary.\n\nAfter owning the Wave for a month, I bought the Staedtler Noris Jumbo stylus[^amazon], which is much better at a great price (~$35). The stock stylus had stopped working as expected. For some reason, it would only erase, no matter what tool was selected. My research prior to buying the Wave did not lead me to believe it's common for the stock stylus to crap out so quickly. So I can't say you should factor the cost of another stylus into the budget/risk factor. I appear to have just run into a bit of bad luck.\n\n### Case\nThe case is simple, light, and functional. \n\nThe front cover folds around with no hitches, making the device is easy to hold with one hand. The pen loop ensures you never lose your stylus. Cutouts along the top and bottom edges give access to the charging port and buttons for power and the front light.\n\nBut how well does it protect the Wave? I haven't dropped it yet, so I can't really say. But the device isn't as fragile as an iPad, which uses a glasses screen, so I imagine the case works just fine.\n\n## The MobiScribe Wave vs. similar devices\nThe complete package of the MobiScribe Wave can be tough to gauge. For $230, you get a complete bundle including the MobiScribe Wave, case, stylus, and USB-C cable. \n\nNow, let's glance at **how the MobiScribe Wave compares to its peers in terms of price and value:**\n- $450 for the cheapest bundle (device, stylus, cover) from Remarkable\n- $275 for a refurbished Remarkable (device only); $299 for new (device only)\n- Nearly $400 for a comparable Kindle Scribe bundle (with only 16GB of storage)\n- ~$550 for a similar bundle for the Supernote Ratta A5X (a comparable device to the Remarkable 2 and Kindle Scribe)\n- ~$420 for a similar bundle for the Supernote Ratta A6X (comparable in size to the MobiScribe Wave\n\n**Please note:** The prices listed here are normal MSRP and do not account for potential sales. Also, you may save money if you don't buy a full bundle.\n\nThe Wave comes with 64GB of storage. The Kindle Scribe bundles start at 16GB. The Remarkable 2 has only 8GB of storage, with no expansion options.\n\nThe Wave includes a front light, which is not available on any of the Remarkable 2 devices at any price point.\n\nNone of the Wave's competitors claim to offer waterproof devices. (Is the Wave *really* waterproof? No idea, as I don't plan on testing that feature any time soon.)\n\nThe Wave lets you download other apps via the Google Play Store. This feature helps to make the Wave a more nearly complete reading device by making it easier to check in on your RSS feeds and saved articles. As far as I know, the Remarkable 2 doesn't let you download any extra apps. And Kindle wants to limit you to their store and ecosystem. With the Wave, you can read ebooks via apps including Kindle, Kobo, Libby, and Hoopla to name a few. If you care about other apps and doing things beyond reading and writing, then a full-fledged e-ink tablet from Onyx's Boox line may be more up your alley. But keep in mind the Boox devices are much more expensive than the MobiScribe Wave (and most of the other devices mentioned in this post).\n\n## Initial setup\nAfter connecting to WiFi, I downloaded the tolino app for ebooks and the Adobe PDF app. You can download these apps from the MobiStore app--no account required.\n\nThen I transferred my ebooks via USB-C and I was ready to go. (**NOTE:** If you're using a Mac, you'll have to download the Android File Transfer app. Sometimes I have to connect the device multiple times before the app works. I don't know if this issue is unique to the Wave, or if it's typical with most Android devices and Macs.\n\n**UPDATE:** Since the original post, I have since transferred books via USB-C on Fedora Onyx, which was a much smoother experience, so Linux users may have better luck.)\n\nI've also enabled the Google Play Store on the device and have downloaded apps including Firefox and wallabag.\n\n## How I've been using the MobiScribe Wave\n\n### As a writing device\nSince I got the Wave, **I've used it for every version of writing I can think of:**\n- Journal entries.\n- Short stories.\n- Blog posts.\n- Doodles.\n- Meeting notes.\n\nI've yet to find a reason to go back to physical notebooks and pens.\n\n### E-reader\nWhen it comes to reading, the Wave feels like a Kindle on steroids.\n\nAs you would expect, I can read ebooks on it.

Thanks to AI, more of the things we want are only a click or a prompt away.

But I still have concerns. At what point does technology rob us of originality&ndash;and when is that scenario okay, and when is it not?</p>\n<p>Should we be concerned about the loss of originality in terms of cold hard facts? We likely don&rsquo;t care about originality when it comes to complex math&ndash;think balance sheets and revenue forecasting. In those cases, the work to get those numbers isn&rsquo;t the point&ndash;deciding what to do with information is the point.</p>\n<p>But what about fields we&rsquo;ve traditionally considered more artistic? Fields like writing, music, and graphic design. In such fields, there&rsquo;s not so much separation between the process and the end result. So, the process is more largely <em>the point</em>. What you choose to include or exclude may be subjective. These decisions are part of your style, one of the more crucial aspects of art. Number crunching doesn’t leave much room for style. But the arts are all about style.</p>\n<p>As we remove ourselves from the creative process and forfeit agency to AI and <a href=\"https://jakelacaze.com/2023/01/10/social-media-engagement.html\">algorithms</a>, at what point are we enabling the erosion of style?</p>\n<p>The prophets of AI will say that AI tools can unlock creativity previously unrealized. Maybe that&rsquo;s true for a small segment of people. Call me cynical, but I imagine few will put in the time to learn how to improve results from prompts. Most will put in minimum effort and take whatever AI gives them, leading to an ever-more homogeneous internet. The future is more likely to be less original. The tools meant to empower us will instead make us all the same.</p>\n<p>People probably don&rsquo;t expect numbers to have personality and quirks.

				"content_text": "\n*As we rely more on AI, aren't we at risk of sounding just like everyone else?*\n\n---\n\nThe prophets of AI continue to promise their favored tech will make our lives easier. Thanks to AI, more of the things we want are only a click or a prompt away. You can now inject AI wherever you want, as AI can help you with writing, creating music, and editing images, as just a few examples.\n\nI don't fault anyone for using these offerings, especially because I have used them in my own way and will continue to do so at different points in my life. But I still have concerns. At what point does technology rob us of originality--and when is that scenario okay, and when is it not?\n\nShould we be concerned about the loss of originality in terms of cold hard facts? We likely don't care about originality when it comes to complex math--think balance sheets and revenue forecasting. In those cases, the work to get those numbers isn't the point--deciding what to do with information is the point.\n\nBut what about fields we've traditionally considered more artistic? Fields like writing, music, and graphic design. In such fields, there's not so much separation between the process and the end result. So, the process is more largely *the point*. What you choose to include or exclude may be subjective. These decisions are part of your style, one of the more crucial aspects of art. Number crunching doesn’t leave much room for style. But the arts are all about style.\n\nAs we remove ourselves from the creative process and forfeit agency to AI and [algorithms](https://jakelacaze.com/2023/01/10/social-media-engagement.html), at what point are we enabling the erosion of style?\n\nThe prophets of AI will say that AI tools can unlock creativity previously unrealized. Maybe that's true for a small segment of people. Call me cynical, but I imagine few will put in the time to learn how to improve results from prompts. Most will put in minimum effort and take whatever AI gives them, leading to an ever-more homogeneous internet. The future is more likely to be less original. The tools meant to empower us will instead make us all the same.\n\nPeople probably don't expect numbers to have personality and quirks. But we expect these personal touches from artistic projects.\n\nArt goes beyond having the right answer. Art is also about the habits of the artist--AKA style. Style is the artist's most-cherished asset. Style is what makes the audience relate to the art and the artist.\n\nAs we further integrate AI into art, are we at risk of losing those stamps of authenticity we unknowingly put in our work? Those little hints that remind our audiences that we're the authors of our own works? And if style is the most valuable thing we have, are we smart to risk losing it?\n\n<p class=\"note\"><em>\nJake LaCaze has been been using images generated by DALL-E 2 as cover images on this blog as a joke, but he thinks this one is actually damn good.</em></p>\n",

In this anecdote, Musk made the point that people take for granted that technology progresses on its own, as if it&rsquo;s an unwritten law of the universe. As if things just move forward with time.</p>\n<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to get Musk&rsquo;s point out of my head after first hearing it. Why? What&rsquo;s so significant about it? What does it really mean?</p>\n<p>To me, it means humans have agency in shaping their future. More importantly, humans have a <em>responsibility</em> in shaping that future.</p>\n<p>Too many of us accept that things will just work out. Or that they won&rsquo;t. Whatever our outlook, we get complacent. We take whatever we can get. We accept the future and consequences we&rsquo;re dealt. We blame the dealer even though we never acted on our chance to cut the deck.</p>\n<p>Technology is not some mysterious force. There is no invisible hand of technology moving it in one direction or the other. Technology is the byproduct of our creations and the norms we create around using those creations.</p>\n<p>At the time of this writing, AI is all the rage. I don&rsquo;t think AI is worthy of being injected into every aspect of our lives, but unfortunately, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it <em>won&rsquo;t</em> be injected into every area and situation possible. But this strategy is unforgivably reckless, because, as John Oliver said in his bit about AI on <em>Last Week Tonight</em><sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem with AI isn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s smart&ndash;it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s stupid in ways we can&rsquo;t always predict.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On his Substack, Gary Marcus recently echoed this sentiment when he pointed out how DALL-E 3<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup>, the latest version of OpenAI&rsquo;s image generator, had problems showing black doctors with white patients, or a watch showing the time of 1 o&rsquo;clock.<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">5</a></sup> We still don&rsquo;t know the ways in which AI has unintentional bias.

				"content_text": "\n*Technology doesn't progress on its own simply because we expect it to.*\n\n---\n\nOn a recent episode of Andrew Yang's *Forward* podcast[^1], Walter Isaacson shared an anecdote he picked up while shadowing Elon Musk for the entrepreneur's recently-released eponymous biography[^2]. In this anecdote, Musk made the point that people take for granted that technology progresses on its own, as if it's an unwritten law of the universe. As if things just move forward with time.\n\nI haven't been able to get Musk's point out of my head after first hearing it. Why? What's so significant about it? What does it really mean?\n\nTo me, it means humans have agency in shaping their future. More importantly, humans have a *responsibility* in shaping that future.\n\nToo many of us accept that things will just work out. Or that they won't. Whatever our outlook, we get complacent. We take whatever we can get. We accept the future and consequences we're dealt. We blame the dealer even though we never acted on our chance to cut the deck.\n\nTechnology is not some mysterious force. There is no invisible hand of technology moving it in one direction or the other. Technology is the byproduct of our creations and the norms we create around using those creations.\n\nAt the time of this writing, AI is all the rage. I don't think AI is worthy of being injected into every aspect of our lives, but unfortunately, that doesn't mean it *won't* be injected into every area and situation possible. But this strategy is unforgivably reckless, because, as John Oliver said in his bit about AI on *Last Week Tonight*[^3]:\n\n> The problem with AI isn't that it's smart--it's that it's stupid in ways we can't always predict.\n\nOn his Substack, Gary Marcus recently echoed this sentiment when he pointed out how DALL-E 3[^4], the latest version of OpenAI's image generator, had problems showing black doctors with white patients, or a watch showing the time of 1 o'clock.[^5] We still don't know the ways in which AI has unintentional bias. And we do a disservice by presenting AI as being limitlessly intelligent, when in fact its capabilities very much depend on *how* it's trained and *what* it's trained *on*.\n\nAt the risk of becoming a broken record, I'll say it again: AI has potential. We should explore where and how it can help humanity. But we must do so in a responsible manner. We must be thoughtful and deliberate. Right now, we're being anything but.\n\nTechnology doesn't simply advance *just because*. It moves along the path we create for it. And I hope more people will start chiming in on which path we set this risky technology on. Just because there are risks involved doesn't mean there aren't great benefits waiting. But again, those benefits won't happen on their own. We must play our part in making those benefits reality.\n\n[^1]: [Walter Isaacson on Elon, X, and breaking the rules](https://megaphone.link/CAD8374507134)\n[^2]: [*Elon Musk* by Walter Isaacson](https://books2read.com/u/b5wLg7)\n[^3]: [*Last Week Tonight* on AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqa8Zo2XWc4)\n[^4]: [DALL-E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3)\n[^5]: [Race, statistics, and the persistent cognitive limitations of DALL-E](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/race-statistics-and-the-persistent)\n",

How can it be that our social systems benefit one type of person while alienating the other?[^alienation]</p>\n<p>Pop culture often presents the introvert as being inadequate and odd, a type of person to be fixed or merely tolerated when possible. Introverts are often described as antisocial, but it would be more accurate to say introverts have a different threshold for social interaction. I, as an introvert, recognized this distinction during the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, I thought I&rsquo;d be fine in isolation. But forced social distancing revealed that I craved interaction. Interaction itself wasn&rsquo;t the issue—the quality and frequency of interaction were the real questions.</p>\n<p>And those questions of quality and frequency have led to my questioning online interactions, mostly via social media. This extroverted world expects us to be everywhere online at all times. Digital tools are available to help us scale, to be present at many places at once. But operating this way leads to the problems of the quality and the frequency of conversation. We&rsquo;re told to keep the conversation going so that the social media engagement algorithms<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> favor us and push our content to more viewers in the name of promoting the conversation—conversation we may not even want to be part of.</p>\n<p>In her book <em>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&rsquo;t Stop Talking</em><sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>, Susan Cain argues that introverts need seclusion to recover after interactions. Introverts tend to perceive more than extroverts, Cain says, so introverts have more to sort through after social situations. This always &lsquo;ON&rsquo; world of social media means introverts have an endless wave of interactions to process, all of this in addition to their offline interactions.</p>\n<p>But what about the physical world, the one we live in without the need for screens? Where&rsquo;s the concern about making sure we&rsquo;re present there, and that we can process all happening around us? How can any anyone hope to process anything when new events are constantly dinging for our attention? We&rsquo;re constantly connected to the world at all times. But why? Do we want to be? Should we want to be?</p>\n<p>Questions like these are the ones that have been floating in my head since I started reading <em>Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now</em><sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> by Douglas Rushkoff. What exactly does &lsquo;present&rsquo; mean? What is the true present moment? The tangible present, or the virtual present?</p>\n<p>Are these questions as concerning for extroverts? Or, do they feel the more <em>presents</em>, the better? If you see an issue, you must then consider the costs, both the costs of being so present and also the cost of not being present. You must find your own balance and determine when and where you want to be present—or have the energy to do so. Some will try to convince you that you must be everywhere. But if you&rsquo;re everywhere, are you really ever anywhere? This is the same question I ask of those hoping to scale their presence with the help of AI. Doesn&rsquo;t being everywhere in such fashion cheapen the worth of your time and presence? Isn&rsquo;t your scarce availability the true value of your presence? Is there any added value in our <em>truly</em> being present? Will anyone know the difference?</p>\n<p>The promise of &lsquo;community&rsquo; is supposed to be part of the appeal of social media and the modern web. But so many digital platforms seek to be a one-size-fits-all solution for the masses. &lsquo;Community&rsquo; and &lsquo;masses&rsquo; are often conflicting terms. How often can we have community if we invite the masses? To be noticed on these platforms often requires appeasing to the masses while ignoring your potential true audience, meaning the masses then distract from the true community.</p>\n<p>Our presence is more than a simple commodity. Or is it?</p>\n<p>By embracing digital extroversion, not only are we giving away our attention and our presence—we&rsquo;re also giving away data, which recently may have been used to train generative AI models we now fear may take our jobs<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Living as an extrovert introduces noise, both literal and figurative, into your life, which is fine if you’re up for it.

The extroverted web says you’re missing out on the endless firehouse of content that will be outdated and irrelevant by the time you learn about it. You’re also missing out on exposure, as the most crucial part of the online growth formula seems to be consistency, meaning you must constantly churn out content so that your audience doesn’t forget you.</p>\n<p>These days, there’s far too much content to stay current on.

But having these remedies to boredom always at arm&rsquo;s length makes it hard to be present in the real world beyond the screens. We must also fight the temptation to live always in a digital world when tech titans are always telling us what a great option it is.

I still believe it <em>can</em>, with some caveats. Inserting technology into a process or situation doesn&rsquo;t guarantee success. And it&rsquo;s hard to do the right way. Drumming up hype and excitement is easy, but those same elements make it hard to know if the technology is actually useful, or useful to the extent promised.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve reached a point where we need to put this convenience into perspective. Has it really been all that great? Has it served us as users? Even if everything was great in the past, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to go along for the ride in the future. Maybe some people feel the past cost of convenience was fine, but they&rsquo;re not so sure about the costs of what&rsquo;s ahead. Or, maybe we don&rsquo;t have a choice. Maybe certain things are set in motion, meaning the future is already determined and there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it. To be clear, I don&rsquo;t hold this view, but if you do, I hope you&rsquo;ll agree we should consider what lies ahead as we can best prepare ourselves.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend to have a crystal ball that shows the future. While I ponder our future, I&rsquo;m no futurist. I prefer to discuss how things <em>can</em> go rather than how they <em>will</em> go. So while I don&rsquo;t have predictions of the future, I do have concerns and hopes. I&rsquo;m concerned that certain advances in technology seek to make humans irrelevant<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>. But I hope we can find our way to maintain&ndash;and improve&ndash;our humanity.</p>\n<p>What does it mean to be human in the 21st century? What are our best parts that should be amplified?

Many businesses will adopt these AI 'solutions' haphazardly, putting humans at risk in the name of efficiency.\n\nI grew up enamored with technology, believing it could make life better. I still believe it *can*, with some caveats. Inserting technology into a process or situation doesn't guarantee success. And it's hard to do the right way. Drumming up hype and excitement is easy, but those same elements make it hard to know if the technology is actually useful, or useful to the extent promised.\n\nWe've reached a point where we need to put this convenience into perspective. Has it really been all that great? Has it served us as users? Even if everything was great in the past, that doesn't mean we have to go along for the ride in the future. Maybe some people feel the past cost of convenience was fine, but they're not so sure about the costs of what's ahead. Or, maybe we don't have a choice. Maybe certain things are set in motion, meaning the future is already determined and there's nothing we can do about it. To be clear, I don't hold this view, but if you do, I hope you'll agree we should consider what lies ahead as we can best prepare ourselves.\n\nI don't pretend to have a crystal ball that shows the future. While I ponder our future, I'm no futurist. I prefer to discuss how things *can* go rather than how they *will* go. So while I don't have predictions of the future, I do have concerns and hopes. I'm concerned that certain advances in technology seek to make humans irrelevant[^2]. But I hope we can find our way to maintain--and improve--our humanity.\n\nWhat does it mean to be human in the 21st century? What are our best parts that should be amplified? And which parts should be improved upon? These are fair questions, and there are so many similar questions deserving consideration. So I hope you'll join me as I do my best to do them justice.\n\nYou can follow along via [RSS](/rss/) or [email](/newsletter/).

				"content_html": "<p>The more I learn about nuclear, the more I become convinced it&rsquo;s the key to solving our energy woes. And Michael Shellenberger&rsquo;s <em>Apocalypse Never</em><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> may have pushed me over the edge.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://jakelacaze.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e48f33b44c.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Michael Shellenberger&rsquo;s Apocalypse Never\">\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cover of Michael Shellenberger&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apocalypse Never<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nPhoto credit: Amazon<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Why are environmentalists so strongly opposed to nuclear energy? Nuclear is abundant, clean, and energy dense. Yet so-called environmentalists (or, perhaps more appropriately, environmental alarmists) keep pushing for solar and wind, which are proven to be inefficient and terrible for the environment in their own ways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-dangers-of-environmental-alarmism\">The dangers of environmental alarmism</h2>\n<p><em>Apocalypse Never</em> is not a book about climate change denialism. Shellenberger believes in climate change and also believes humans play a role.</p>\n<p>But he argues climate change is not the same as climate catastrophe, and environmental alarmism does more harm than good.</p>\n<p>Shellenberger&rsquo;s case has merit when you look into some details of environmental alarmism.</p>\n<p>For one, enviornmental alarmists don&rsquo;t look at how we can adapt to climate change. They instead repeat the narrative that it&rsquo;s too late and that climate change can&rsquo;t be stopped. While climate change may unstoppable, it&rsquo;s not necessarily catastrophic. And if it&rsquo;s inevitable, then we should learn to live with the coming changes, which is far more productive than waving our hands in the air and declaring the end. Humans are adaptive and resilient. The sooner we start changing with the times, the better.</p>\n<p>Another aspect to consider is the hypocrisy of developed nations pushing developing nations to &ldquo;leapfrog&rdquo; straight to renewable energy while bypassing fossil fuels. Never mind the fact that sources of renewable energy such as solar and wind are expensive and not as efficient as fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>Rather than focus on holding back the developing nations, those already developed should consider how to responsibly help them progress. Developed nations should lean into alternative fuels where it makes sense, while helping developing nations improve their infrastructure with fossil fuels and then accelerate into alternative fuels. Restricting developing nations from improving their own infrastructure hurts the citizens of those nations. It&rsquo;s easy for the developed nations to push this agenda when they themselves are not affected by the policies they promote.</p>\n<p>The public narrative suggests that fans of renewable energy see the agents of fossil fuels as their enemy. But Shellenberger raises the possibility that these two industries instead have a shared enemy in nuclear energy.</p>\n<p>Shellenberger shows example after example of environmental groups and individual advocates (such as Sierra Club and Al Gore) accepting money from fossil fuel companies, which feels like a stark contradiction to their ideology.</p>\n<p>But, when you look for the similarities between fossil fuel companies and renewable energy companies, you find a shared hatred of nuclear energy.</p>\n<p>Shellenberger then asks the logical question: &ldquo;[H]ow long, exactly, have oil and gas interests been funding environmental groups to shut down nuclear plants?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If nuclear is as good as advertised, then how much need would there be for other forms of energy?</p>\n<p>Much of the opposition to nuclear energy is simply out of line.</p>\n<p>Some point to Chernobyl as a warning. But Chernobyl was more an issue of Soviet neglect than an issue of nuclear power<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>But what about Fukushima? Turns out neglect was an issue there as well<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The tsunami countermeasures taken when Fukushima Daiichi was designed and sited in the 1960s were considered acceptable in relation to the scientific knowledge then, with low recorded run-up heights for that particular coastline. But some 18 years before the 2011 disaster, new scientific knowledge had emerged about the likelihood of a large earthquake and resulting major tsunami of some 15.7 metres at the Daiichi site. However, this had not yet led to any major action by either the plant operator, Tepco, or government regulators, notably the Nuclear &amp; Industrial Safety Agency (NISA). Discussion was ongoing, but action minimal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This negligence rhymes a bit with the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans, which we now know was made worse by <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/hurricane-katrina-levee-failures\">faulty levees</a> neglected despite warnings they were inadequate for a major storm.</p>\n<p>In each of these cases, humans could have done more to lessen the damage of these disasters. But many choose to scapegoat the disasters themselves rather than look at what we could have done better. Such negligence will only be perpetuated by the narrative that it&rsquo;s too late and that there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about our impending doom.</p>\n<p>Shellnberger argues that ideology is to blame and calls environmental alarmism the new secular religion.</p>\n<p>Many have already accepted our climate apocalypse, so they look only for validation while rejecting the idea of improving our situation. Religious zealots often quote their religious tomes when referencing modern events as proof of the coming Armageddon. Environmental alarmists do much the same, except they quote choice books of science.</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;ve accepted an outcome, you default to validating it, rather than remaining open to the possibility you may be wrong. So the enviromental alarmists reject any data contradicting their gloomy predictions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-green-is-renewable-energy-really\">How green is renewable energy really?</h2>\n<p>When you scratch beneath the surface, you start to see <strong>issues with the renewable energy narrative</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How green are electric vehicles (EVs) if they&rsquo;re getting electricity from fossil fuels<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup>?</li>\n<li>How are the materials used for EVs, solar panels, and windmills mined, manufactured, and installed?

				"content_text": "In November of last year I wanted a convenient way to carry my jounral, pens, and Kindle together. These items easily fit into my backpack I use for my day job. But sometimes I don't want to carry my laptop and chargers and everything else I usually carry to and from the office.\n\nI wanted something that would make it easy to keep my writerly items together so I could easily remove them from my backpack in one motion. \n\nSo I took advantage of a Black Friday deal and bought the [diodrio A5 zipper journal cover](https://www.amazon.com/diodrio-Moleskine-LEUCHTTURM-Sketchbook-Refillable/dp/B0BBQSY7Y5/ref=sr_1_3?crid=19R103S80YGZ1&keywords=diodrio+a5&qid=1675027739&sprefix=diodrio+a5%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-3). \n\n![diodrio A5 zipper journal cover as featured on Amazon](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91mGbGURREL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)<br>\n<small>*diodrio A5 zipper journal cover—Image courtsey of product listing on Amazon*</small>\n\nThis cover isn't a necessity. But it packs a lot of convenience for what I paid for it: less than $11.\n\n🗒️ **Disclaimer:** I am not affiliated with the product or any of the companies mentioned in this review. I bought this product with my own money and wrote this review by choice.\n\n## diodrio A5 zipper journal cover specifications\nBelow are some highlights featured on the Amazon product listing:\n\n- Dimensions: 6.9\" x 9.8\"\n- Can hold A5 notebook or notepad\n- Zipper to keep contents secure\n- 2 front pouches to hold pens or other items\n- Inside features:\n    - 3 card slots\n    - 1 mesh pocket\n- Water resistant cover <br>\n(I have not tested this feature and have no plans to do so.)\n- List price: $22.99\n- Price I paid: $10.99\n\n🗒️ **Note:** This item was listed at $11.99 on January 29, 2023. So it may be on sale, depending on when you're reading this review.\n\n## Use and experience\nThis cover works as expected. And at a great price.\n\nThe cover has plenty space to hold a thick A5 journal. Mine is holding an [A5 journal from SAKAEtp](https://www.dromgooles.com/sakae-tp-68-gsm-tomoe-river-paper-368-page-plain.html), with 368 pages of 68gsm Tomoe River paper. Whether the cover can hold your journal of choice will also depend on what else you hold inside the cover.\n\nThe inside of my cover holds a journal and my Kindle Oasis.\n\nAnd my front pocket holds a few pens--like my [Pilot Kakuno](https://jakelacaze.com/2023/01/29/the-pilot-kakuno.html)--and a mechanical pencil.\n\nOne of the front pockets can hold an iPhone 7 without a case. (Do what you will with that information.)\n\nBecause the cover can hold an A5 notebook or notepad, you can use one of the slots for extra storage. Maybe for a few sticky notes.\n\n![diodrio A5 zipper journal cover inside notebook and notepad pockets](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Hp-2AeowL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)\n<small>*Photo courtesy of Amazon product listing*</small>\n\nThe product listing boasts that the cover includes a strap for easy carrying. But it adds little to no value for me. I prefer to hold and carry the cover like a large hardcover book.\n\n## Is the diodrio A5 zipper journal cover worth it?\nFor the price I paid—$10.99 plus tax—the answer is YES.\n\nIs it worth the list price of $22.99? That question is harder to answer because I didn't pay full price. \n\nBut I'm again leaning toward yes. \n\nThis cover includes a lot of storage options in a neat, tiny package. \n\nI can't yet speak to the cover's long-term durability. But it's held up well in my first couple months of use. I haven't tried to destroy the cover. But I also haven't been the gentlest with it due to its low price.\n\nThis cheap cover has scratched itches I've had for more expensive covers such as the [zip folios from Galen Leather](https://www.galenleather.com/collections/zippered-leather-portfolio/zip-a5) for $119.\n\nThere are certainly nicer (and more expensive) covers out there. But it's hard to imagine many more practical than the diodrio A5 zipper  journal cover on sale.\n",

				"title": "Social media engagement algorithms and the illusion of choice",
				"content_html": "<p>So many of us, over the last couple years, have been rethinking our relationship with social media and the internet at large.</p>\n<p>My own wonderings about technology have seen me dabbling into using only open source operating systems and software. But I&rsquo;ve recently realized that while I appreciate open source and like the idea of all technology being open source, I am not an open source purist or absolutist. Like so many digital citizens, I have concerns about privacy and security. But in these areas, again, I am not a purist.</p>\n<p>If I feel this way about technology at large, it only makes sense that I have similar concerns about social media. And I imagine I&rsquo;m not alone.</p>\n<p>So if I&rsquo;m correct, then it makes sense to ask:</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-the-problem-with-social-media\">What&rsquo;s the problem with social media?</h2>\n<p>Social media used to be a way to stay in touch with friends and family and random weirdos you found in various corners of the internet. But now it feels like this thing we do out of habit, even though it drives us crazy.</p>\n<p>The problem with social media overwhelmingly seems to be the engagement algorithms. The efforts to keep us coming back for more to boost ad revenue, even if that increased engagement results in angrier users.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-so-bad-about-social-media-engagement-algorithms\">What&rsquo;s so bad about social media engagement algorithms?</h2>\n<p>Angry users—a side effect of these engagement algorithms—is definitely a problem. But I think there&rsquo;s another factor that doesn&rsquo;t get enough attention: These engagement algorithms lead to an illusion of choice.</p>\n<p>Users put effort into finding and following relevant and interesting voices, only to have another factor—the abstract yet opaque engagement algorithms—determine their experience on a social network.</p>\n<p>When we don&rsquo;t know how these algorithms work—or <em>when</em> they&rsquo;re working—how can we be confident in our ability to build or curate own digital experience? Where is the line between being responsible for our own experience and being manipulated by mysterious forces we&rsquo;re ill-equipped to fight?</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://calnewport.com\">Cal Newport</a> has pointed out, social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram built their services through network effects. People joined these sites to connect with others they knew or were interested in. And the fact everyone they knew was already on these established sites was enough to keep them there. Leaving behind your connections and starting over was too costly.</p>\n<p>But these social media giants gave up the advantage of network effects when they started using engagement algorithms. They threw away the main reason people used their services.\nAnd in so many ways, the move from network effects to engagement algorithms felt like a bait and switch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-arent-engagement-algorithms-on-tiktok-a-problem\">Why aren&rsquo;t engagement algorithms on TikTok a problem?</h2>\n<p>While concerns about security and privacy on TikTok <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/tiktok-fires-4-employees-who-used-internal-data-to-spy-on-journalists/\">appear valid</a>, this post will ignore, but not <em>discount</em>, those concerns to stay on one point.</p>\n<p>While users may have concerns about the types of content the TikTok algorithms serve, most users are not bothered by the presence of algorithms themselves on the service. Unlike the case with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, engagement algorithms are part of the appeal of TikTok. On TikTok, the algorithms are a feature, not a bug.</p>\n<p>TikTok can get by with using algorithms because TikTok doesn&rsquo;t give users the illusion of control. TikTok doesn&rsquo;t pretend to deliver content based on whom you follow. It&rsquo;s common knowledge that TikTok&rsquo;s engagement algorithms, aided with data from your views, likes, comments, and shares, decide what you see in your main feed. You have to choose the Following feed for the hope of seeing content from those you follow. So while keeping up with those you follow is an option, it is not the default. TikTok is made for finding engaging content, not for keeping up with those you already know. TikTok <em>kind of</em> gives you the option to follow individuals, but it doesn&rsquo;t put much effort into that angle.</p>\n<p>While TikTok may be worthy of criticisms in some areas, the service deserves credit in terms of algorithms. While parent company ByteDance may not be transparent about how TikTok&rsquo;s engagement algorithms work, it has at least been transparent in the fact TikTok operates through engagement algorithms.</p>\n<p>Users are aware of the presence of algorithms when they sign up for TikTok. They know what they&rsquo;re getting into. And they&rsquo;re mostly fine with that because they&rsquo;re not signing up to keep in touch with friends and family as they did on other sites.</p>\n<h2 id=\"can-social-networks-have-any-value-once-engagement-algorithms-are-present\">Can social networks have any value once engagement algorithms are present?</h2>\n<p>The network effect seems to persist only as long as social media services steer clear of engagement algorithms.

				"content_text": "So many of us, over the last couple years, have been rethinking our relationship with social media and the internet at large.\n\nMy own wonderings about technology have seen me dabbling into using only open source operating systems and software. But I've recently realized that while I appreciate open source and like the idea of all technology being open source, I am not an open source purist or absolutist. Like so many digital citizens, I have concerns about privacy and security. But in these areas, again, I am not a purist.\n\nIf I feel this way about technology at large, it only makes sense that I have similar concerns about social media. And I imagine I'm not alone.\n\nSo if I'm correct, then it makes sense to ask:\n\n## What's the problem with social media?\nSocial media used to be a way to stay in touch with friends and family and random weirdos you found in various corners of the internet. But now it feels like this thing we do out of habit, even though it drives us crazy.\n\nThe problem with social media overwhelmingly seems to be the engagement algorithms. The efforts to keep us coming back for more to boost ad revenue, even if that increased engagement results in angrier users.\n\n## What's so bad about social media engagement algorithms?\nAngry users—a side effect of these engagement algorithms—is definitely a problem. But I think there's another factor that doesn't get enough attention: These engagement algorithms lead to an illusion of choice.\n\nUsers put effort into finding and following relevant and interesting voices, only to have another factor—the abstract yet opaque engagement algorithms—determine their experience on a social network.\n\nWhen we don't know how these algorithms work—or *when* they're working—how can we be confident in our ability to build or curate own digital experience? Where is the line between being responsible for our own experience and being manipulated by mysterious forces we're ill-equipped to fight?\n\nAs [Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com) has pointed out, social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram built their services through network effects. People joined these sites to connect with others they knew or were interested in. And the fact everyone they knew was already on these established sites was enough to keep them there. Leaving behind your connections and starting over was too costly.\n\nBut these social media giants gave up the advantage of network effects when they started using engagement algorithms. They threw away the main reason people used their services. \nAnd in so many ways, the move from network effects to engagement algorithms felt like a bait and switch.\n\n## Why aren't engagement algorithms on TikTok a problem?\n\nWhile concerns about security and privacy on TikTok [appear valid](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/tiktok-fires-4-employees-who-used-internal-data-to-spy-on-journalists/), this post will ignore, but not *discount*, those concerns to stay on one point.\n\nWhile users may have concerns about the types of content the TikTok algorithms serve, most users are not bothered by the presence of algorithms themselves on the service. Unlike the case with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, engagement algorithms are part of the appeal of TikTok. On TikTok, the algorithms are a feature, not a bug.\n\nTikTok can get by with using algorithms because TikTok doesn't give users the illusion of control. TikTok doesn't pretend to deliver content based on whom you follow. It's common knowledge that TikTok's engagement algorithms, aided with data from your views, likes, comments, and shares, decide what you see in your main feed. You have to choose the Following feed for the hope of seeing content from those you follow. So while keeping up with those you follow is an option, it is not the default. TikTok is made for finding engaging content, not for keeping up with those you already know. TikTok *kind of* gives you the option to follow individuals, but it doesn't put much effort into that angle.\n\nWhile TikTok may be worthy of criticisms in some areas, the service deserves credit in terms of algorithms. While parent company ByteDance may not be transparent about how TikTok's engagement algorithms work, it has at least been transparent in the fact TikTok operates through engagement algorithms.\n\nUsers are aware of the presence of algorithms when they sign up for TikTok. They know what they're getting into. And they're mostly fine with that because they're not signing up to keep in touch with friends and family as they did on other sites.\n\n## Can social networks have any value once engagement algorithms are present?\nThe network effect seems to persist only as long as social media services steer clear of engagement algorithms. A couple such examples include [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social) and [micro.blog](https://micro.blog).\n\nNetworks on LinkedIn once had value because the connections were likely to be genuine, in that you either knew the person you connected to, or you had an interest in that person. But now, many connections are made only for the intent of increasing who sees a member's content, AKA *engagement*.\n\nAnd once users figure what gets engagement, it's only natural that many would start creating content in the tried-and-true formula. So users see the same types of content over and over. Originality exists on these platforms. But it goes unseen, unrecognized, unappreciated. And so mainstream social media becomes the digital suburbs, full of cookie cutter houses lined with the same bushes and political signs.\n\n## What's the answer to social media engagement algorithms?\nWhile [web3 promises to solve all our digital woes](/2022/12/19/the-simple-math.html), I find the solution to be a simple and old technology: **RSS**.\n\nWatch the video below if you're unfamiliar with the wonders of RSS:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0klgLsSxGsU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n🗒️ **Note:** This video is 15 years old, so it doesn't address that Google Reader is now dead. At only $15 a year, [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app) a great alternative. Or check out [Reeder 5](https://reederapp.com/) or [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) if you're on Mac/iOS/iPad OS.\n\n## How does RSS fix the illusion of control?\nRSS is the obvious choice for one simple reason: It doesn't give the *illusion* of control—it instead gives actual control.\n\nWith RSS, you decide what to subscribe to. You decide what's important to you. You decide what you pay attention to.\n\nYou are once again responsible for your online experience.\n\nSure, curating your experience takes a little more effort than relying on social media engagement algorithms. But it's worth it.\n",

While Newport himself is no fan of social media, he leaves it up to individuals to define their own relationships with the tech they use regularly. Newport&rsquo;s most important message is to <a href=\"https://jakelacaze.com/2023/12/29/the-problem-with.html\">get philosophical with technology</a> and you think about where it fits in your life, not that we all reach the same conclusions and use or avoid all the same services.</p>\n<p><em>Digital Minimalism</em> is not a how-to guide. It is instead a guide calling its readers to develop their own philosophy about where technology fits into their lives.</p>\n<p>After I started reading the book, I deleted from my phone nearly every app not related to calling, texting, or navigation.</p>\n<p>Newport suggests suspending use of any problematic apps for a month. He refers to this time as the &ldquo;decluttering&rdquo; period. Once the decluttering period is over, you re-introduce the temporarily banned tech back into your usage and observe whether you think it still has a place in your life. Newport claims that often people realize they no longer need the tech, making their decluttering periods permanent.</p>\n<p>I made it a week before I reversed my declutter, because I&rsquo;m <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y2eCJeNgc0\">lacking in moral fiber</a>. But I have kept <em>most</em> social apps from my phone this go round.</p>\n<p>And though I have deviated from Newport&rsquo;s recommendations, I have started creating distance between myself and my phone. I&rsquo;ve started leaving it behind in other rooms of the house. And my short break does seem to have made putting my phone down much easier when I know I need to.</p>\n<p>My declutter has made me realize how much I prefer the desktop (or laptop) experience over the mobile experience in most situations. I&rsquo;m an elder millennial, so I&rsquo;m better with a traditional keyboard and mouse than I am with an onscreen keyboard.</p>\n<p>I recently got a couple used (or &ldquo;previously enjoyed&rdquo;) laptops through my job. The laptops are nowhere near the latest and greatest specs. They can&rsquo;t upgrade to Windows 11, but they run Linux just fine (currently <a href=\"https://getsol.us/home/\">Solus</a>).</p>\n<p>Still, these laptops are thin and powerful enough for everything I need. Ten or fifteen years ago, it would been impossible to think of how I could ever need anything more. Especially when you consider the near ubiquity of public wifi.</p>\n<p>But now, in the age of smartphones, we want the same conveniences once reserved for laptops at our disposal through these devices many of us keep in our pockets at all times.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s easy to gush over tech like laptops when propping it against the smartphone. Perhaps the smartphone is a scapegoat, the villainous flavor of the week.</p>\n<p>I do not believe eliminating smartphones will fix everything. We would find a substitute for distraction, perhaps laptops and desktop computers.</p>\n<p>But that&rsquo;s a problem we can address when we&rsquo;ve improved our relationships with our smartphones. This acknowledgment makes us better prepared in the war for our attention.</p>\n<p>While Newport doesn&rsquo;t say everyone should delete all social media, he doesn&rsquo;t hide his opinion that social media holds little to no value. (He&rsquo;s no fan of <a href=\"https://jakelacaze.com/2023/01/10/social-media-engagement.html\">social media engagement algorithms</a> either.) These days it&rsquo;s fashionable to jump on Newport&rsquo;s side and crap on social media while ignoring any benefits.</p>\n<p>The reason I fell in love with the Internet way back in the late &rsquo;90s is the same reason I stick around on social media and related platforms in 2022: The potential for connection that&rsquo;s harder to find offline.</p>\n<p>Connections made over the Internet are not a substitute for connections with my family and other people I see offline. While I can get along with almost anyone I meet face to face, there are very few I can nerd out with on anything that truly interests me. Or at least not to the depth I want to go.</p>\n<p>Also, I tend to hop from interest to interest. It&rsquo;s always nice to know I can find other parties interested in the same things, on the Internet, often in the form of social media.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I would feel differently if I were part of some sort of establishment I could fall back on.</p>\n<p>But I would be disingenuous to gloss over my gripes with social media, which relies on sloppy algorithms to decide which content is worth promoting. (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Meta, LinkedIn, Twitter . . .)</p>\n<p>When I think back to my favorite times in online communities, they were often in communities that hadn&rsquo;t yet been adopted by the masses. And while that may make me sound like an idealistic hipster who wants to keep his hangouts under the radar so that he can have them all to himself, I find my defense more practical than that.</p>\n<p>The simple truth is that, in most cases:</p>\n<p><strong>Mass adoption = commoditization.</strong></p>\n<p>And once you start catering to everyone, you end up serving no one. And, at some point, the experiences all run together, as the users and their avatars do. And you get an experience similar to what you likely find offline, in which few of the experiences stand out above the rest.</p>\n<p>Before reading <em>Digital Minimalism</em>, I was becoming convinced that a return to smaller online communities was the best path forward. I still believe that in theory, though I haven&rsquo;t begun practicing it as well as I should.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure of the exact limits of this practice either. Obvious candidates include places like <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a> and niche Mastodon servers. Maybe even the smaller subreddits. I suppose you can create an insular experience on Twitter if you follow the right people.</p>\n<p>While I would like to see a break from <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/web-2-ending?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2\">the worst of Web 2.0</a>, I&rsquo;m thinking <a href=\"https://web3isgoinggreat.com/\">Web 3.0 is most likely not the answer</a>.</p>\n<p>Does that mean Newport&rsquo;s preference for walking away from social media is the answer?</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not ready to jump on that train. But I can&rsquo;t blame anyone who does.</p>\n<p>I hope this essay shines some light on the need for philosophy in all aspects of our lives, even in technology.</p>\n",

But I have kept *most* social apps from my phone this go round. \n\nAnd though I have deviated from Newport's recommendations, I have started creating distance between myself and my phone. I've started leaving it behind in other rooms of the house. And my short break does seem to have made putting my phone down much easier when I know I need to.\n\nMy declutter has made me realize how much I prefer the desktop (or laptop) experience over the mobile experience in most situations. I'm an elder millennial, so I'm better with a traditional keyboard and mouse than I am with an onscreen keyboard.\n\nI recently got a couple used (or \"previously enjoyed\") laptops through my job. The laptops are nowhere near the latest and greatest specs. They can't upgrade to Windows 11, but they run Linux just fine (currently [Solus](https://getsol.us/home/)).\n\nStill, these laptops are thin and powerful enough for everything I need. Ten or fifteen years ago, it would been impossible to think of how I could ever need anything more. Especially when you consider the near ubiquity of public wifi.\n\nBut now, in the age of smartphones, we want the same conveniences once reserved for laptops at our disposal through these devices many of us keep in our pockets at all times.\n\nPerhaps it's easy to gush over tech like laptops when propping it against the smartphone. Perhaps the smartphone is a scapegoat, the villainous flavor of the week. \n\nI do not believe eliminating smartphones will fix everything. We would find a substitute for distraction, perhaps laptops and desktop computers.\n\nBut that's a problem we can address when we've improved our relationships with our smartphones. This acknowledgment makes us better prepared in the war for our attention.\n\nWhile Newport doesn't say everyone should delete all social media, he doesn't hide his opinion that social media holds little to no value. (He's no fan of [social media engagement algorithms](https://jakelacaze.com/2023/01/10/social-media-engagement.html) either.) These days it's fashionable to jump on Newport's side and crap on social media while ignoring any benefits.\n\nThe reason I fell in love with the Internet way back in the late '90s is the same reason I stick around on social media and related platforms in 2022: The potential for connection that's harder to find offline.\n\nConnections made over the Internet are not a substitute for connections with my family and other people I see offline. While I can get along with almost anyone I meet face to face, there are very few I can nerd out with on anything that truly interests me. Or at least not to the depth I want to go.\n\nAlso, I tend to hop from interest to interest. It's always nice to know I can find other parties interested in the same things, on the Internet, often in the form of social media.\n\nPerhaps I would feel differently if I were part of some sort of establishment I could fall back on.\n\nBut I would be disingenuous to gloss over my gripes with social media, which relies on sloppy algorithms to decide which content is worth promoting. (I'm looking at you, Meta, LinkedIn, Twitter . . .)\n\nWhen I think back to my favorite times in online communities, they were often in communities that hadn't yet been adopted by the masses. And while that may make me sound like an idealistic hipster who wants to keep his hangouts under the radar so that he can have them all to himself, I find my defense more practical than that. \n\nThe simple truth is that, in most cases:\n\n**Mass adoption = commoditization.**\n\nAnd once you start catering to everyone, you end up serving no one. And, at some point, the experiences all run together, as the users and their avatars do. And you get an experience similar to what you likely find offline, in which few of the experiences stand out above the rest.\n\nBefore reading *Digital Minimalism*, I was becoming convinced that a return to smaller online communities was the best path forward. I still believe that in theory, though I haven't begun practicing it as well as I should.\n\nI'm not sure of the exact limits of this practice either. Obvious candidates include places like [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) and niche Mastodon servers. Maybe even the smaller subreddits. I suppose you can create an insular experience on Twitter if you follow the right people.\n\nWhile I would like to see a break from [the worst of Web 2.0](https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/web-2-ending?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2), I'm thinking [Web 3.0 is most likely not the answer](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/).\n\nDoes that mean Newport's preference for walking away from social media is the answer?\n\nI'm not ready to jump on that train. But I can't blame anyone who does.\n\nI hope this essay shines some light on the need for philosophy in all aspects of our lives, even in technology.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I entered college knowing only that I wanted to write for a living.</p>\n<p>I had accepted that I wasn&rsquo;t going to support myself on the paperback royalties of novels I would never write. Technical writing sounded unimaginative, and I&rsquo;m not sure my university offered such a program anyway. Therefore, journalism seemed my only option, so I stepped onto campus as a journalism major. By the end of my first quarter, I had switched to Undecided, as I then had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, but journalism was not part of those future plans. Fast forward to 2021, and I doubt anyone would say with a straight face that I made the wrong decision. But I can say with the straightest of faces that I made the right decision for the wrong reasons.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t remember much of my time in Journalism 101 other than I got an A for the course. In terms of writing, the most practical takeaway was to lead with a hard-hitting point and then follow with the details and backstory. I didn&rsquo;t immediately realize how this method could also apply to fiction, the best example I can think of being the opening of <em>Choke</em> by Chuck Palahniuk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re going to read this, don&rsquo;t bother.</p>\n<p>After a couple of pages, you won&rsquo;t want to be here. So forget it. Go away. Get out while you&rsquo;re still in one piece.</p>\n<p>Save yourself.</p>\n<p>There has to be something better on television . . .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those opening lines may not have given me many concrete details about the story that followed, but they gave me enough to get the feel.

				"content_text": "I entered college knowing only that I wanted to write for a living. \n\nI had accepted that I wasn't going to support myself on the paperback royalties of novels I would never write. Technical writing sounded unimaginative, and I'm not sure my university offered such a program anyway. Therefore, journalism seemed my only option, so I stepped onto campus as a journalism major. By the end of my first quarter, I had switched to Undecided, as I then had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, but journalism was not part of those future plans. Fast forward to 2021, and I doubt anyone would say with a straight face that I made the wrong decision. But I can say with the straightest of faces that I made the right decision for the wrong reasons.\n\nI don't remember much of my time in Journalism 101 other than I got an A for the course. In terms of writing, the most practical takeaway was to lead with a hard-hitting point and then follow with the details and backstory. I didn't immediately realize how this method could also apply to fiction, the best example I can think of being the opening of *Choke* by Chuck Palahniuk:\n\n> If you're going to read this, don't bother.\n>\n> After a couple of pages, you won't want to be here. So forget it. Go away. Get out while you're still in one piece.\n> \n> Save yourself.\n>\n> There has to be something better on television . . . \n\nThose opening lines may not have given me many concrete details about the story that followed, but they gave me enough to get the feel.

				"title": "Untold truths about grief",
				"content_html": "<p>From time to time, someone will accuse me of having a morbid fascination with death. But <em>fascination</em> is inaccurate; my relationship with death is closer to a familiarity slowly working its way to acceptance. Death and the resulting losses and grief have had a big influence on me over the last few years. In short, loss has opened my eyes to certain realities, has shaped so many of my views, and has changed the very essence of who I am.</p>\n<p>In the Spring of 2011, my mother was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. The news came as a heavy blow. Then, a few months later, my father received a similar diagnosis: lung cancer, though a different form. If that wasn’t enough to try to deal with, the progressions of their cancers certainly were.</p>\n<p>My mother’s battle with cancer lasted seven or eight months. About four months before she ultimately passed away, she was pronounced dead when she stopped breathing for a few minutes. Per my mother’s wishes, my stepfather fulfilled the unenviable task of asking the doctor not to resuscitate her. But somehow my mother sprang back to life and continued fighting for a few more months before ultimately passing away a couple days after Thanksgiving. During that time, everyone around her watched her deteriorate and wither away. Those images still haunt me going on seven years later. As strange as this may sound, it’s easier to accept her death than it is to accept how she died. Whether logical or not, I can’t help feeling that a similar fate awaits me at some point.</p>\n<p>Unlike the case with my mother, my father passed away quickly after his diagnosis. He didn’t quite make it a month. I was scheduled to visit him two days after he passed. To make matters worse, I hadn’t seen my father in about two and a half years. So, that obviously brings its own pains and guilt that I don’t think I need to explain or elaborate.</p>\n<p>The losses didn’t stop there. In 2014, I lost my stepfather, who passed away due to complications from diabetes. Unlike the case with my parents, his death caught me completely off-guard. I knew that he was having health problems, but I had never considered the possibility of death. Or if I had, I likely felt that death would be a bit further down the road.</p>\n<p>Whenever I relay these details, I catch myself wondering if that is indeed how it happened. Even now, just the thought of having to deal with those losses in such fashion shakes me. These losses were so close together — especially the losses of my parents — and each played out in its own unique way. When I contrast and compare them, I’m able to come up with a variety of takeaways that I feel are worth sharing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"there-is-no-perfect-closure\">There is no perfect closure.</h2>\n<p>Some of us are concerned with having an ideal death. We convince ourselves that if things play out a certain way, the whole experience won’t be too painful.</p>\n<p>Each loss I suffered brought unique grief. I can’t say I fully prefer one to the other. While I’m grateful that I was able to have more time with my mother, I know every moment she was alive created pain and torture for her. I can only imagine the conflict of wanting your suffering to end but also knowing that the end will come only when you&rsquo;ve passed. Looking back, I now realize what a gift it is to have no hatchets to bury and no wrongs to right. If you have the opportunity to set things right before tragedy strikes, I highly recommend that you do it. Doing so will allow you to focus on the things that truly matter and will help to bring a little order to the chaos.</p>\n<p>I wish I’d had the opportunity to see my father one last time, but at least he didn’t have to suffer as long as my mother did. While his quick passing brings its own comforts, it also denied the opportunity for certain conversations I wish we&rsquo;d had. If I’m being completely honest and self-aware, I likely wouldn’t have had the courage to initiate these conversations, as it’s taken me nearly seven years to sort through my feelings to articulate said feelings. But as things played out, I never had the chance. And that’s something I wish I could change.</p>\n<p>And with my stepfather’s passing, I learned what it was like to be shocked when someone leaves this world without warning. There’s a big difference between accepting that someone has finally passed and accepting that someone has abruptly passed. But both situations have one thing in common–pain and suffering. You can sit around and philosophize about which flavor of grief you prefer, but at the end of the day you’re still eating a dish you wish you’d never been served. Kind of like Grandma’s <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/foodblog/2010/02/16/20-unholy-recipes-dishes-so-awful-we-had-to-make-them\">vienna sausage shortcake</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"grief-is-not-linear\">Grief is not linear.</h2>\n<p>Rather than acknowledge my grief and seek help of any sort, I repeatedly told myself that I should be over it by now. It’d been a year or two years or three years — how long was I going to take to get over these deaths? When would I be okay? When would I feel normal again?</p>\n<p>I’ve accepted I will never get over these losses. Instead, I must continue to learn to live with them. I’ve come to realize that on any given day, I have no clue what will trigger or stir a reaction in me. Just when I think it’ll never bother me again, I watch a movie or a TV show centered around the themes of death and loss and my eyes fill up. Even though I can’t articulate what exactly is going on inside, I allow myself to feel it. And that’s something that took years to find the courage to do.</p>\n<p>The journey is not straight. Along the way you’ll encounter many strange paths, and at times you may find yourself feeling as if you’re possibly regressing. That’s okay; it’s part of the process. You can’t take your hands off the wheel and just coast to the finish line; get ready for some curves and u-turns.</p>\n<p><em>The only way out is through.</em></p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I can now say it took me about ten years to learn how to put my grief in a good place, which I define as being able to talk about it without being triggered in any way. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m <em>over it</em>. I&rsquo;ve simply learned how to live with it, how to store it and carry it with me. But, like the Mogwai, sometimes you have to open up the box and let it out. Just don&rsquo;t feed it after midnight.</p>\n<p>So stop <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XN0NtrnfMY\">looking forward on paths sideways</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dont-invalidate-your-grief\">Don’t invalidate your grief.</h2>\n<p>At some point, I realized I wasn’t giving myself permission to grieve. This halted my healing for years. One way I denied my grief was by telling myself that there were some who had had it far worse.</p>\n<p>*Some people lost their parents when they were much younger.</p>\n<p>Some people had lost family due to murder or wars.*</p>\n<p>Comparing and contrasting grief in this manner does little good. The fact remains that my experience still sucked, and I have no problem saying that now. When I say it, I’m not asking for pity. I’m simply acknowledging the situation.</p>\n<p><em>It sucked. It still does.</em></p>\n<p>When I think about this point, I’m always reminded of the time I heard a hospice representative ask, “What is the greatest pain the world?”</p>\n<p>The group I was in offered various answers, but the most popular answer by far was <em>the death of a child</em>. Who’s going to argue that one, right?</p>\n<p>But I now realize that the death of a child can be the greatest pain in the world only if you’ve experienced it, because as the the hospice worker made me realize when she answered her question, the greatest pain in the world is whatever pain you’re experiencing at the moment. This realization has made it easier for me to offer compassion to the pains of others as well as the pains of my own. In the end, it doesn’t matter how my pain stacks up to others’; my pain is my own, and it’s the only pain I know.</p>\n<p>Also, dealing with these kinds of matters is a balance. Yes, there are times when you have to box up your feelings and get through the day. But you do have to give yourself the opportunity to be real about how you’re feeling. Or how else can you hope to improve your feelings if you never acknowledge their true intricacies?</p>\n<h2 id=\"bring-on-the-empathy\">Bring on the empathy.</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I always cry at funerals, even if I didn’t know the person.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— My Uncle Cecil, at my grandfather’s funeral</p>\n<p>I was fifteen years old when I heard those words from my Uncle Cecil. At the time, I hadn’t had the life experience to understand and appreciate what he was saying. But I like to think I now have a much better idea, because these days I never know when a certain moment will move me to tears. Maybe the tears will come when a co-worker starts crying during her retirement party when she becomes a mess of emotions as she’s so excited to say hello to a new chapter of her life while she’s also afraid of saying goodbye to a familiar chapter. Or maybe they’ll come when I find myself an absolute mess at the end of <em>The Iron Giant</em>. (Before you ask, yes, both of those things have actually happened.)</p>\n<p>While these moments lead to embarrassment, they also allow for greater connection with others as well as with myself. Sometimes these moments are in no way obviously related to my experiences with loss. I like to think that simply being reminded time and time again about the fleeting nature of life has given me an ability to realize emotions that were once unreachable. Regardless of whether my theory is spot-on or completely vain, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee925OTFBCA\">sometimes you just need a good cry</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"death-is-something-we-need-to-talk-about-more\">Death is something we need to talk about more.</h2>\n<p>Death is inevitable, no matter how hard we try to deny it. Death is the last major event of life. We need to acknowledge this without letting fear get in the way. The least we can do is try to face our end with some dignity.</p>\n<p>For the first couple years of my son’s life, I felt bad for him because before he was even born, he’d already lost out on so much love from people expected to be close to him.

				"content_text": "From time to time, someone will accuse me of having a morbid fascination with death. But *fascination* is inaccurate; my relationship with death is closer to a familiarity slowly working its way to acceptance. Death and the resulting losses and grief have had a big influence on me over the last few years. In short, loss has opened my eyes to certain realities, has shaped so many of my views, and has changed the very essence of who I am.\n\nIn the Spring of 2011, my mother was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. The news came as a heavy blow. Then, a few months later, my father received a similar diagnosis: lung cancer, though a different form. If that wasn’t enough to try to deal with, the progressions of their cancers certainly were.\n\nMy mother’s battle with cancer lasted seven or eight months. About four months before she ultimately passed away, she was pronounced dead when she stopped breathing for a few minutes. Per my mother’s wishes, my stepfather fulfilled the unenviable task of asking the doctor not to resuscitate her. But somehow my mother sprang back to life and continued fighting for a few more months before ultimately passing away a couple days after Thanksgiving. During that time, everyone around her watched her deteriorate and wither away. Those images still haunt me going on seven years later. As strange as this may sound, it’s easier to accept her death than it is to accept how she died. Whether logical or not, I can’t help feeling that a similar fate awaits me at some point.\n\nUnlike the case with my mother, my father passed away quickly after his diagnosis. He didn’t quite make it a month. I was scheduled to visit him two days after he passed. To make matters worse, I hadn’t seen my father in about two and a half years. So, that obviously brings its own pains and guilt that I don’t think I need to explain or elaborate.\n\nThe losses didn’t stop there. In 2014, I lost my stepfather, who passed away due to complications from diabetes. Unlike the case with my parents, his death caught me completely off-guard. I knew that he was having health problems, but I had never considered the possibility of death. Or if I had, I likely felt that death would be a bit further down the road.\n\nWhenever I relay these details, I catch myself wondering if that is indeed how it happened. Even now, just the thought of having to deal with those losses in such fashion shakes me. These losses were so close together — especially the losses of my parents — and each played out in its own unique way. When I contrast and compare them, I’m able to come up with a variety of takeaways that I feel are worth sharing.\n\n## There is no perfect closure.\n\nSome of us are concerned with having an ideal death. We convince ourselves that if things play out a certain way, the whole experience won’t be too painful.\n\nEach loss I suffered brought unique grief. I can’t say I fully prefer one to the other. While I’m grateful that I was able to have more time with my mother, I know every moment she was alive created pain and torture for her. I can only imagine the conflict of wanting your suffering to end but also knowing that the end will come only when you've passed. Looking back, I now realize what a gift it is to have no hatchets to bury and no wrongs to right. If you have the opportunity to set things right before tragedy strikes, I highly recommend that you do it. Doing so will allow you to focus on the things that truly matter and will help to bring a little order to the chaos.\n\nI wish I’d had the opportunity to see my father one last time, but at least he didn’t have to suffer as long as my mother did. While his quick passing brings its own comforts, it also denied the opportunity for certain conversations I wish we'd had. If I’m being completely honest and self-aware, I likely wouldn’t have had the courage to initiate these conversations, as it’s taken me nearly seven years to sort through my feelings to articulate said feelings. But as things played out, I never had the chance. And that’s something I wish I could change.\n\nAnd with my stepfather’s passing, I learned what it was like to be shocked when someone leaves this world without warning. There’s a big difference between accepting that someone has finally passed and accepting that someone has abruptly passed. But both situations have one thing in common–pain and suffering. You can sit around and philosophize about which flavor of grief you prefer, but at the end of the day you’re still eating a dish you wish you’d never been served. Kind of like Grandma’s [vienna sausage shortcake](https://www.riverfronttimes.com/foodblog/2010/02/16/20-unholy-recipes-dishes-so-awful-we-had-to-make-them).\n\n## Grief is not linear.\n\nRather than acknowledge my grief and seek help of any sort, I repeatedly told myself that I should be over it by now. It’d been a year or two years or three years — how long was I going to take to get over these deaths? When would I be okay? When would I feel normal again?\n\nI’ve accepted I will never get over these losses. Instead, I must continue to learn to live with them. I’ve come to realize that on any given day, I have no clue what will trigger or stir a reaction in me. Just when I think it’ll never bother me again, I watch a movie or a TV show centered around the themes of death and loss and my eyes fill up. Even though I can’t articulate what exactly is going on inside, I allow myself to feel it. And that’s something that took years to find the courage to do.\n\nThe journey is not straight. Along the way you’ll encounter many strange paths, and at times you may find yourself feeling as if you’re possibly regressing. That’s okay; it’s part of the process. You can’t take your hands off the wheel and just coast to the finish line; get ready for some curves and u-turns.\n\n*The only way out is through.*\n\n**UPDATE:** I can now say it took me about ten years to learn how to put my grief in a good place, which I define as being able to talk about it without being triggered in any way. That doesn't mean I'm *over it*. I've simply learned how to live with it, how to store it and carry it with me. But, like the Mogwai, sometimes you have to open up the box and let it out. Just don't feed it after midnight.\n\nSo stop [looking forward on paths sideways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XN0NtrnfMY).\n\n## Don’t invalidate your grief.\n\nAt some point, I realized I wasn’t giving myself permission to grieve. This halted my healing for years. One way I denied my grief was by telling myself that there were some who had had it far worse.\n\n*Some people lost their parents when they were much younger.\n\nSome people had lost family due to murder or wars.*\n\nComparing and contrasting grief in this manner does little good. The fact remains that my experience still sucked, and I have no problem saying that now. When I say it, I’m not asking for pity. I’m simply acknowledging the situation.\n\n*It sucked. It still does.*\n\nWhen I think about this point, I’m always reminded of the time I heard a hospice representative ask, “What is the greatest pain the world?”\n\nThe group I was in offered various answers, but the most popular answer by far was *the death of a child*. Who’s going to argue that one, right?\n\nBut I now realize that the death of a child can be the greatest pain in the world only if you’ve experienced it, because as the the hospice worker made me realize when she answered her question, the greatest pain in the world is whatever pain you’re experiencing at the moment. This realization has made it easier for me to offer compassion to the pains of others as well as the pains of my own. In the end, it doesn’t matter how my pain stacks up to others’; my pain is my own, and it’s the only pain I know.\n\nAlso, dealing with these kinds of matters is a balance. Yes, there are times when you have to box up your feelings and get through the day. But you do have to give yourself the opportunity to be real about how you’re feeling. Or how else can you hope to improve your feelings if you never acknowledge their true intricacies?\n\n## Bring on the empathy.\n\n> “I always cry at funerals, even if I didn’t know the person.” \n\n— My Uncle Cecil, at my grandfather’s funeral\n\nI was fifteen years old when I heard those words from my Uncle Cecil. At the time, I hadn’t had the life experience to understand and appreciate what he was saying. But I like to think I now have a much better idea, because these days I never know when a certain moment will move me to tears. Maybe the tears will come when a co-worker starts crying during her retirement party when she becomes a mess of emotions as she’s so excited to say hello to a new chapter of her life while she’s also afraid of saying goodbye to a familiar chapter. Or maybe they’ll come when I find myself an absolute mess at the end of *The Iron Giant*. (Before you ask, yes, both of those things have actually happened.)\n\nWhile these moments lead to embarrassment, they also allow for greater connection with others as well as with myself. Sometimes these moments are in no way obviously related to my experiences with loss. I like to think that simply being reminded time and time again about the fleeting nature of life has given me an ability to realize emotions that were once unreachable. Regardless of whether my theory is spot-on or completely vain, [sometimes you just need a good cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee925OTFBCA).\n\n## Death is something we need to talk about more.\n\nDeath is inevitable, no matter how hard we try to deny it. Death is the last major event of life. We need to acknowledge this without letting fear get in the way. The least we can do is try to face our end with some dignity.\n\nFor the first couple years of my son’s life, I felt bad for him because before he was even born, he’d already lost out on so much love from people expected to be close to him. While I’m still bothered by this fact, it does help to know that I have the opportunity to teach him things that most parents aren’t equipped for. I’m still not sure about the timing or the exact technique, but I do understand the importance and I know that it’s something I won’t back down from.\n\nDeath and loss are part of the human experience, and we’re doing ourselves a disservice when we refuse to acknowledge that fact. Also, I like to think that as we become more comfortable with the certainty of death, we also find the clarity for better living.\n\n## It feels good to think I can help others.\n\nOne thing that lessens the pain is finding a way to come away with lessons from this experience. And it helps more if I can find a way to pass those lessons on to others who may need them. I’m aware what the pain of loss is like, and if I can help to alleviate that pain for someone else for even a tiny bit, I consider it a good deed done. I’ve also learned that it often helps to know that you’re not alone, no matter what’s ailing you.\n\n## But if I’m being honest, it isn’t all about helping others.\n\nI wish I could claim to be completely selfless. But the truth is that talking about my experience is an outlet, and finding outlets helps me. Also, every time I’m able to share my story, I find something new. I find another layer to the onion. I take away something new, and I grow just a little bit more. And so I like to think that by helping myself I’m able to help others, which may not sound very altruistic. But it’s real.\n\nRefusing to be real about this part of my life took a toll on me in many ways. It beat me down and got the best of me. It filled a significant chunk of my life with darkness and robbed me of so much potential joy. In short, it wasn’t working. And when what you’ve been trying hasn’t been working, it’s time to try something new. And this post is part of my effort to be more open about my experience.\n\nThank you for me letting me share a bit of myself with you.\n",

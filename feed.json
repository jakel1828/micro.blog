				"content_text": "In so many ways, the internet sucks.\n\nSocial media engagement algorithms have made it even harder to find quality content worthy of our attention[^algorithms]. These algorithms don't push stories *you* care about. They instead push stories other people care about in the hopes that you'll fit into the same bucket as other consumers. They provide access to an abundance of content, but the content is often, quite frankly, *crap*. (Feel free to substitute a stronger word if you like.)\n\nUnfortunately, the only answer I've found for these algorithms requires some work. We must take ownership of our own digital experience and curate the content we want to see. We can't afford to rely on the machines to inform or entertain us.\n\nLately, I've started using my MobiScribe Wave[^wave] as my own digital newspaper. Though the Wave is firstly an e-ink writing tablet, I appreciate that I can read and annotate interesting articles directly on a device I often keep at my side.\n\nThe rest of this post will give some insight into the tools and setup that help me curate my own digital newspaper. This post is intended as an overview, not as a comprehensive step-by-step guide, but I will do my best to include helpful links for anyone who wants to replicate my system.\n\n## The tools\nBelow is a list of the tools I use to help me pay attention to the written digital content that matters to me:\n\n- NewsBlur[^newsblur] (RSS service)\n- Syncthing[^syncthing] (Free, open source syncing service)\n- MobiScribe Wave (The actual e-ink device, powered by Android)\n- Raspberry Pi (This device works as a syncing hub and is optional to this workflow.)\n\nNow, let's take a look at how each device fits in.\n\n### NewsBlur\nNewsBlur, my RSS service of choice, is the most labor-intensive part of this process. Creating an account and signing up for the service are simple. But finding and adding feeds worth following takes time and effort.\n\nAnyone familiar with an RSS reader will expect NewsBlur to routinely update articles for any added RSS feeds. But NewsBlur has another feature that doesn't get enough attention: A dedicated email address for turning email newsletters into RSS articles[^newsletters].\n\nIf you're familiar with the wisdom of the statement *Crap in, crap out*, then you understand the importance of NewsBlur. If I put crap into NewsBlur, then I should expect to get crap out. Finding and curating content worth finding is the most difficult--but also most crucial--part of this process.\n\n### Syncthing\nSyncthing is your personal free and open source alternative to Dropbox.\n\nI use Syncthing to sync PDF copies of interesting articles from my NewsBlur feeds into my MobiScribe Wave. Early on, I used Dropbox for this purpose, but I ran into some issues.\n\nFor one, the free tier of Dropbox didn't let me automatically save articles to my device, a crucial detail if I want to mark up and annotate the articles I read (which I sometimes do). This limitation meant I had to manually go into Dropbox and then save the articles to my device. This extra step led to managing two libraries: The files saved to my Wave, as well as those saved on Dropbox. *No bueno.*\n\nWithout Syncthing, managing my digital articles was a nightmare, until the day I realized the MobiScribe Wave is an Android device, meaning it should work with Syncthing's Android app.\n\nAnd so far, it has worked brilliantly.\n\n### MobiScribe Wave\nAt this point, there's little to add about the MobiScribe Wave. For the most part, I use the device as usual with the caveat that I must make sure the device is connected to the internet and that Syncthing is working to sync my articles.\n\nI set up Sycthing on the Wave as I would any other device, allowing me to manage only *one* library instead of two, as I had to do when I was using Dropbox. For simplicity, I'm syncing the Books folder on my Wave.

I already had a Raspberry Pi and I've found it valuable considering how I use it in this process. But I don't recommend you go out and buy a Raspberry Pi (or comparable device) if you don't already have one.\n\nSo how am I using it?\n\nIn my current set up, my laptop syncs with the Raspberry Pi. And the Raspberry Pi syncs with the Wave. But the my laptop and the Wave **do not** sync to each other.\n\nBelow is a simple illustration to show how my devices sync with each other.\n\n![A simple flowchart of my digital newspaper workflow](/uploads/2024/diagram-of-digital-newspaper-workflow.png)\n\nMy laptop and Wave *could* sync directly with each other.

Whatever your industry, you’re in business to serve your customers or clients. If you’re not doing that, then why the hell should you expect to stay in business? Why should anyone continue to give you their money if they’re not really getting anything back in return?</p>\n\n<p>The SaaShole is a mindset. Despite its specific name, the SaaShole mindset doesn’t apply only to those in SaaS. It applies to tech all the way up and down the industry.</p>\n\n<p>Often, tech companies are selling tech solutions to non-tech people—people who don’t identify as working in <em>the tech industry</em>. So tech bros (and sisses) are often better off assuming their customers know little about tech beyond how to check their email on their smartphone, because these customers aren’t concerned about the tech—they’re concerned about solving an issue and completing a task that they don’t view through the lens of technology. If tech can help them, great—they’re all for the help. </p>\n\n<p>But for them, tech is a means to an end, not the end itself. (The good news is that if you’re wrong in assuming that your customers know next to nothing about tech, you can always deepen the technical explanations to meet them where they are. Starting with the default assumption your customers don’t know much about tech and then ramping up seems a better strategy than bombarding them with more they can handle and then trying to bring it down to their level.)</p>\n\n<p>I’ve previously written about how I think tech suffers from a lack of philosophy beyond ‘Move fast and break things’<sup><a href=\"#fn4-24053\" id=\"fnr4-24053\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">4</a></sup>.

				"content_text": "<p>This post is not a straight-up ‘MobiScribe Wave vs. Kindle Scribe’ kind of post because I can’t compare the devices themselves. As I said in my MobiScribe perspective post <sup><a href=\"#fn1-21982\" id=\"fnr1-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, I’ve only demoed the Kindle Scribe at my local Best Buy. But, as someone who’s used numerous Kindle e-ink readers over the years, I can speak to the advantages of the MobiScribe Wave over the Kindle ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>And with that said, let’s get to it.</p>\n\n<h2>The limitations of the Kindle ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p>With the Kindle Scribe—like any other Kindle e-ink device—you are not buying a device that opens the door to other platforms; you are instead buying into a limited ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>Out of the box (and hacking solutions aside), you can’t download other apps for reading content outside of purchases made directly from Kindle. </p>\n\n<p>Apple often gets flak for the walled garden aspects of its own ecosystem, especially on iPhone and iPad devices. But to Apple’s credit, at least they do let you download apps outside their ecosystem, though to be fair, those same apps may not be the easiest to use, as is the case with apps that can sync to Apple’s mobile devices only via iCloud. (Obsidian comes to mind<sup><a href=\"#fn2-21982\" id=\"fnr2-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>. To sync Obsidian with mobile devices, you have only two options: iCloud and Obsidian Sync. At a cost of $8 per month, Obsidian Sync isn’t a great alternative for everyone.) The point is that Apple’s ecosystem has its issues, but it’s nothing compared to Kindle’s.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of apps and functionality, if you go with the Kindle Scribe, you better be completely satisfied with the Kindle ecosystem because the Kindle e-ink devices are basically gateways <em>only</em> to Amazon content. By default—again assuming you haven’t hacked the device—all your content comes from the Kindle Store. You do have the option to transfer ebooks from your computer, which would most likely require stripping the DRM, unless you got the books already DRM-free. But most normies aren’t going to go that route.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Fortunately, you can still save money on ebooks via the Kindle if your library offers access to the Libby app<sup><a href=\"#fn3-21982\" id=\"fnr3-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>. </p>\n\n<h2>The flexibility of the MobiScribe ecosystem—or lack thereof</h2>\n\n<p>Android tablets, including the MobiScribe Wave, give you plenty options for downloading other apps for reading various written content. </p>\n\n<p>With the Wave, as is the case with other Android tablets, the Kindle Store is simply another option. The device comes with the option to easily download the Kindle app via the MobiStore. But you can also enable Google Play and download other apps, which may save you some money. </p>\n\n<p>As a personal example, I recently figured out how to read current issues of <em>The Economist</em> via the Houston Public Library <sup><a href=\"#fn4-21982\" id=\"fnr4-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> and the PressReader<sup><a href=\"#fn5-21982\" id=\"fnr5-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> app available from Google Play, saving me over $200 a year. With the Kindle, I can read ebooks and publications only if I can purchase or subscribe to them via the Kindle store. Because <em>The Economist</em> recently cut off access via the Kindle store, I have no option to read the magazine on the Kindle, no matter how much I’m willing to pay.</p>\n\n<p>The Wave also lets me download RSS apps and read-it latter apps so that I can keep up with my digital sources, if I so choose. Kindle devices provide no such option, a limitation which keeps them from being the <em>ultimate</em> reading devices.</p>\n\n<h2>Is the Kindle ecosystem all you need?</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the Kindle Scribe is fine if you plan to use it only as it is often promoted: A device first for reading Kindle books and second for some basic writing capabilities. Even though the MobiScribe Wave is, for me, first and foremost an e-ink writing tablet, I still appreciate the reading options it gives me.

But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I won&rsquo;t be thinking about it.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>A career in the volatile oil and gas industry has cured me of any thoughts on making bold predictions. So instead I’ll look at what may happen (instead of what I think will happen) and what I’d like to happen for tech in 2024.</p>\n<h2 id=\"will-the-generative-ai-bubble-burst\">Will the generative AI bubble burst?</h2>\n<p>It’s too hard to say if the generative AI bubble will burst in 2024. But I certainly hope it will. My reasons have been well-documented on this site. For one, I fear the developers of generative AI are too busy trying to sell their non-human-focused solutions rather than solving problems that could help real people<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>If a career in oil and gas has taught me one thing, it’s that ‘boom’ is often another word for ‘bubble.’ And bubbles burst eventually. 2023 brought a great boom for generative AI. Might 2024 bring the bust?</p>\n<p>Fingers crossed.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say the bubble does burst. <em>What follows?</em></p>\n<p>What will the shakeout look like? What developments will stick around?</p>\n<p>The internet didn&rsquo;t go away when the dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s. The internet itself wasn&rsquo;t a total waste; there was just a lot of fat that needed to be trimmed so that we could focus on the useful parts.</p>\n<p>The same logic applies to AI.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of us can get behind the thought of AI having an impact beyond the burst of the bubble. But as Chuck Klosterman pointed out in <em>But What If We&rsquo;re Wrong?</em><sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>, we run into problems when we try to get more specific with such prediction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-2024-the-year-to-regain-control-of-your-digital-home\">Is 2024 the year to regain control of your digital home?</h2>\n<p>With the rise of social media, personal homepages became less important.</p>\n<p>But now with the chaos of Twitter/X, many people are re-thinking their stances on owning their digital home spaces. Many of those same people don’t want to trade one dumpster fire for another by leaning on Meta-owned platforms. So they&rsquo;re looking for niche, sometimes indie, solutions.</p>\n<p>Many are opting to invest in homepages again.</p>\n<p>I spent the last quarter of 2023 setting up my own digital home at jakelacaze.com. 2024 is the year I’ll settle in and hopefully more consistently blog (and maybe include other types of content).</p>\n<p>I don’t know if I’ll ever abandon social media. LinkedIn helps with finding new jobs. And experimenting with platforms like Bluesky adds variety to the online experience. But I know my own webpage should remain my digital focus and that I should use other tools only insofar as they don’t distract me from my own platform.</p>\n<p>I hope more people will join along so that we can make the web weird&ndash;and therefore, <em>fun</em>&ndash;again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"could-logseq-be-a-useful-personal-knowledge-management-system\">Could Logseq be a useful personal knowledge management system?</h2>\n<p>I’ve given Obsidian many tries over the years, but for some reason, it never quite stuck for me.</p>\n<p>In December I tried Logseq and am so far loving it<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Logseq and Obsidian largely do the same thing: They both act as a ‘second brain’ where you can dump information so that you can use your limited brain power on the hard stuff.</p>\n<p>While Obsidian is designed around individual pages, Logseq instead focuses on bullet points. Perhaps because I once tried the bullet journal method<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup>, thinking and organising information in terms of bullet points makes sense to me.</p>\n<p>I hope Logseq can prove to be a tool worth the time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heres-to-hoping-you-find-a-way-to-make-tech-work-for-you-in-2024\">Here&rsquo;s to hoping you find a way to make tech work for you in 2024</h2>\n<p>The tech industry has a habit of making us bend to the tech they build.</p>\n<p>I urge you to instead look at how you can bend tech to work around you. Maybe that requires rethinking how you use tech. Maybe it requires simplifying usage. Or maybe you&rsquo;ve already got everything perfectly figured out.</p>\n<p>Either way, I see little harm in our being more thoughtful about the digital tools we use on a daily basis.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p><a href=\"/blog/is-ai-just-a-solution-looking-for-a-problem/\">Is AI just a solution looking for a problem?</a> on jakelacaze.com&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>\n  \n    <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/101690/9780399184130\"> <em>But What If We're Wrong?</em> by Chuck Klosterman</a>\n  \n\n on Bookshop.org (Affiliate link)&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:3\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p><a href=\"https://logseq.com\">Logseq</a>&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:3\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:4\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM\">How to Bullet Journal</a> on YouTube&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:4\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

But I certainly hope it will. My reasons have been well-documented on this site. For one, I fear the developers of generative AI are too busy trying to sell their non-human-focused solutions rather than solving problems that could help real people[^aibubble].\n\nIf a career in oil and gas has taught me one thing, it’s that ‘boom’ is often another word for ‘bubble.’ And bubbles burst eventually. 2023 brought a great boom for generative AI. Might 2024 bring the bust?\n\nFingers crossed.\n\nLet's say the bubble does burst. *What follows?*\n\nWhat will the shakeout look like? What developments will stick around?\n\nThe internet didn't go away when the dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s. The internet itself wasn't a total waste; there was just a lot of fat that needed to be trimmed so that we could focus on the useful parts.\n\nThe same logic applies to AI.\n\nI'm sure many of us can get behind the thought of AI having an impact beyond the burst of the bubble. But as Chuck Klosterman pointed out in *But What If We're Wrong?*[^klosterman], we run into problems when we try to get more specific with such prediction.\n\n## Is 2024 the year to regain control of your digital home?\nWith the rise of social media, personal homepages became less important.\n\nBut now with the chaos of Twitter/X, many people are re-thinking their stances on owning their digital home spaces. Many of those same people don’t want to trade one dumpster fire for another by leaning on Meta-owned platforms. So they're looking for niche, sometimes indie, solutions.\n\nMany are opting to invest in homepages again.\n\nI spent the last quarter of 2023 setting up my own digital home at jakelacaze.com. 2024 is the year I’ll settle in and hopefully more consistently blog (and maybe include other types of content).\n\nI don’t know if I’ll ever abandon social media. LinkedIn helps with finding new jobs. And experimenting with platforms like Bluesky adds variety to the online experience. But I know my own webpage should remain my digital focus and that I should use other tools only insofar as they don’t distract me from my own platform.\n\nI hope more people will join along so that we can make the web weird--and therefore, *fun*--again.\n\n## Could Logseq be a useful personal knowledge management system?\nI’ve given Obsidian many tries over the years, but for some reason, it never quite stuck for me.\n\nIn December I tried Logseq and am so far loving it[^logseq]. \n\nLogseq and Obsidian largely do the same thing: They both act as a ‘second brain’ where you can dump information so that you can use your limited brain power on the hard stuff.\n\nWhile Obsidian is designed around individual pages, Logseq instead focuses on bullet points. Perhaps because I once tried the bullet journal method[^bujo], thinking and organising information in terms of bullet points makes sense to me.\n\nI hope Logseq can prove to be a tool worth the time.\n\n## Here's to hoping you find a way to make tech work for you in 2024\nThe tech industry has a habit of making us bend to the tech they build.\n\nI urge you to instead look at how you can bend tech to work around you. Maybe that requires rethinking how you use tech. Maybe it requires simplifying usage. Or maybe you've already got everything perfectly figured out.\n\nEither way, I see little harm in our being more thoughtful about the digital tools we use on a daily basis.\n\n<p class=\"note\">\n<em>Jake LaCaze wishes you a happy near year in tech and beyond.</em>\n</p>\n\n[^aibubble]: [Is AI just a solution looking for a problem?](/blog/is-ai-just-a-solution-looking-for-a-problem/) on jakelacaze.com\n[^logseq]: [Logseq](https://logseq.com)\n[^bujo]: [How to Bullet Journal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM) on YouTube\n[^klosterman]: {{< bookshop 9780399184130 >}} <em>But What If We're Wrong?</em> by Chuck Klosterman{{< /bookshop >}} on Bookshop.org (Affiliate link)\n",

But if I’m honest about my needs, I could likely get by on 4GB RAM for a while yet. \n\nThe duo-core CPU is also a bit of a concern.\n\nUnfortunately, the RAM is soldered, so I can’t replace it. And replacing a CPU on a laptop is often equally hopeless. So I’m stuck with these limitations as long as I keep the laptop.\n\nThe good news is that I’d wager I spend 80% of my computer time:\n- Reading RSS feeds.\n- Checking email.\n- Watching YouTube videos.\n- Writing.\n- Basic photo editing (resizing and cropping).\n- Updating my website.\n\nSo it’s not as if I need a beast of a machine for my daily use. Sure, it’d be nice to have more power. But I think I’ll get by just fine. If I do need a more capable computer, I’m lucky to have a newer Mac mini available.\n\nI expect this laptop to serve me well as a secondary mobile machine for at least a couple extra years, at which point maybe I’ll replace it with a machine from 2015. Maybe 2016 if I really feel like splurging.\n\n<p class=\"note\">\n<em>Jake LaCaze really likes the idea of thrifting as he gets older.</em>\n</p>\n\n[^opencore]: [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/)\n",

				"content_text": "\nNietzsche shocked the world when he declared God is dead. (*Kids in the Hall*, not so much[^kith]) \n\nNow, digital philosophers hope to do the same when they declare the death of Twitter.\n\nOn one hand, Twitter will live on through X, whatever the hell that becomes. On other other hand, the essence of Twitter was gone long before Elon Musk bought the platform.\n\nSo what’s next? Most people are trying to answer this question by finding a comparable replacement. How can we fill that bird-shaped void in our souls? Mastodon is too confusing for normies. Bluesky isn’t open to the public and is still available only via an invite code. People seem to be over Threads, as usage has recently dropped over 80%.[^threads].\n\nWhy do we need a one-to-one trade? Why do we need to replace one platform with another? What if we instead replace Twitter with something else completely?\n\nCal Newport recently quoted the author Neil Gaiman as admitting his own blogging, an activity he once enjoyed, had suffered due to microblogging via Twitter[^gaiman]. Gaiman doesn’t think any current platform will replace Twitter. If he’s right, then that means something unlike Twitter must replace it. What will that something be?\n\nSo many of us keep waiting for something to recreate the early vibes of Twitter. But what if Twitter was little more than a moment on the internet? What if that moment is simply gone, lightning that won’t strike twice no matter the platform?\n\nThe essence of Twitter was killed by the pressures of profit. Can any platform serve on the same scale while resisting those same pressures? Someone has to pay for these services, one way or the other. Servers and development ain’t free.\n\nMaybe Twitter should serve as a warning sign of what’s most likely ahead for most platforms like it. And maybe we shouldn’t seek to replace Twitter but to find better, more niche alternatives. \n\nMaybe *Small is the New Big* isn't just the title of a marketing book by Seth Godin[^godin]. Maybe it's also the future of the web.\n\n<p class=\"note\"><em>Jake LaCaze knows it's time to let the Twitter dream die.

				"content_html": "<p><em>The MobiScribe Wave isn&rsquo;t the best e-ink device out there. But it might be all you need.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Over the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with the MobiScribe Wave. Because the device is an interesting mix of value and compromises, you should do your research before you buy.</p>\n<p>This post is less technical than you&rsquo;ll find on most other reviews. I hope to instead give practical perspective to inform your buying decision. The MobiScribe Wave is not a premium device in the same class as the Remarkable 2, Kindle Scribe, or Ratta Supernote. But depending on your usage, the Wave may be all you need.</p>\n<p>While using the Wave as my main writing and reading device for the last month or so, I&rsquo;ve become well-acquainted with its limitations. But I still love the device despite its flaws.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-i-bought-the-mobiscribe-wave\">Why I bought the MobiScribe Wave</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;d had my eye on an e-ink writing tablet for a while now. But at times I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling I wanted one only because I wanted a new toy, and that buying such a device would be a waste of money.</p>\n<p>Comparable e-ink writing tablets from MobiScribe&rsquo;s competitors are significantly more expensive than the Wave&ndash;some over twice as much, depending on what specs and accessories you get.</p>\n<p>Later in this post you&rsquo;ll find a brief comparisons of the Wave and its competitors; hopefully then you&rsquo;ll understand why I was reluctant to splurge on a device I wasn&rsquo;t sure was truly for me. I was tempted to stick with old fashioned pen and paper. But the old ways weren&rsquo;t working out great on my morning and evening train commutes.</p>\n<p>With physical notebooks, I struggle with keeping different types of writing separate in their own notebooks. But it&rsquo;s often more convenient to carry only one notebook. With the MobiScribe Wave, I can now have the best of both scenarios, at a great price.</p>\n<p>With an e-ink notebook, I can switch between reading and writing in a snap, within the same device. And reading my writing partner&rsquo;s stories on my Wave is way easier than reading them on my tiny phone screen (iPhone SE). Also, on my phone, it&rsquo;s too easy to find something else to do with so many apps at my fingertips. So, for a while, I was printing my writing partner&rsquo;s stories out. Making notes on an 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; piece of paper is inconvenient at the best of times on the train, but even more so on those days where it&rsquo;s standing room only.</p>\n<p>Having everything I need on one device cuts down on the number of items I carry in my laptop bag. Each book, notebook, pen, pencil, eraser, etc., adds weight and bulk. Maybe I&rsquo;d feel differently if I got to call my own shots and could work when and where I wanted. But I instead sold my soul to The Man, so the MobiScribe Wave is a great device for me.</p>\n<p>I resisted the urge to buy an e-ink writing tablet for a while. But when Cal Newport kept singing the praises of his Remarkable 2 on the Deep Questions Podcast<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, I could no longer resist. And a certain YouTube video from Voja of My Deep Guide<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> convinced me the Wave was worth taking a chance on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-you-get\">What you get</h2>\n<p>Below is <strong>what you receive when you buy the MobiScribe Wave:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The MobiScribe Wave e-ink notebook.</li>\n<li>MobiScribe&rsquo;s standard Stylus.</li>\n<li>Cover for the device.</li>\n<li>USB-C cable for charging and file transfer (wall plug not included).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-primary-device\">The primary device</h3>\n<p>The primary device feels solid.</p>\n<p>The back has indentions on the side which make it easy to hold.</p>\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d like having a recessed screen, especially because I&rsquo;d gotten used to a flush screen on my Kindle Oasis (before my wife decided she wanted to start reading again and basically stole my Oasis, thereby justifying my purchase of the Wave). But I&rsquo;m happy to report the recessed screen hasn&rsquo;t been an issue. In fact, I&rsquo;ve forgotten it&rsquo;s even an aspect of the device.</p>\n<p>64GB of storage is very generous at this price point. More expensive devices come with much less storage.</p>\n<p>The front light is one of those features that most e-reader fans likely take for granted. But, when you consider that no versions of the Remarkable 2 include a front light, you realize what a luxury it is.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stylus\">Stylus</h3>\n<p>The stylus is fine.</p>\n<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read online, the stylus doesn&rsquo;t give as much feedback as the Remarkable 2&rsquo;s stylus, which may be an issue for some users. The good news is that the Wave is compatiable with most styluses that use Wacom EMR technology, so you can switch out for a better stylus if you like.</p>\n<p>Having an eraser on the end of the stylus is nice. But I can&rsquo;t help wanting to rub when I erase&ndash;like you&rsquo;d expect to do with a pencil eraser&ndash;and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s how I scratched my screen. The scratches aren&rsquo;t bad and I don&rsquo;t find them distracting. But it&rsquo;s disappointing that I&rsquo;m already seeing cosmetic wear and tear after only a month of ownership.</p>\n<p>I replaced the nib after three weeks of usage. I haven&rsquo;t had the device long enough to know if this will be the average lifespan for my nibs. Also, your mileage may vary.</p>\n<p>After owning the Wave for a month, I bought the Staedtler Noris Jumbo stylus<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>, which is much better at a great price (~$35). The stock stylus had stopped working as expected. For some reason, it would only erase, no matter what tool was selected. My research prior to buying the Wave did not lead me to believe it&rsquo;s common for the stock stylus to crap out so quickly. So I can&rsquo;t say you should factor the cost of another stylus into the budget/risk factor. I appear to have just run into a bit of bad luck.</p>\n<h3 id=\"case\">Case</h3>\n<p>The case is simple, light, and functional.</p>\n<p>The front cover folds around with no hitches, making the device is easy to hold with one hand. The pen loop ensures you never lose your stylus. Cutouts along the top and bottom edges give access to the charging port and buttons for power and the front light.</p>\n<p>But how well does it protect the Wave? I haven&rsquo;t dropped it yet, so I can&rsquo;t really say. But the device isn&rsquo;t as fragile as an iPad, which uses a glasses screen, so I imagine the case works just fine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-mobiscribe-wave-vs-similar-devices\">The MobiScribe Wave vs. similar devices</h2>\n<p>The complete package of the MobiScribe Wave can be tough to gauge. For $230, you get a complete bundle including the MobiScribe Wave, case, stylus, and USB-C cable.</p>\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s glance at <strong>how the MobiScribe Wave compares to its peers in terms of price and value:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>$450 for the cheapest bundle (device, stylus, cover) from Remarkable</li>\n<li>$275 for a refurbished Remarkable (device only); $299 for new (device only)</li>\n<li>Nearly $400 for a comparable Kindle Scribe bundle (with only 16GB of storage)</li>\n<li>~$550 for a similar bundle for the Supernote Ratta A5X (a comparable device to the Remarkable 2 and Kindle Scribe)</li>\n<li>~$420 for a similar bundle for the Supernote Ratta A6X (comparable in size to the MobiScribe Wave</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The prices listed here are normal MSRP and do not account for potential sales. Also, you may save money if you don&rsquo;t buy a full bundle.</p>\n<p>The Wave comes with 64GB of storage. The Kindle Scribe bundles start at 16GB. The Remarkable 2 has only 8GB of storage, with no expansion options.</p>\n<p>The Wave includes a front light, which is not available on any of the Remarkable 2 devices at any price point.</p>\n<p>None of the Wave&rsquo;s competitors claim to offer waterproof devices. (Is the Wave <em>really</em> waterproof? No idea, as I don&rsquo;t plan on testing that feature any time soon.)</p>\n<p>The Wave lets you download other apps via the Google Play Store. This feature helps to make the Wave a more nearly complete reading device by making it easier to check in on your RSS feeds and saved articles. As far as I know, the Remarkable 2 doesn&rsquo;t let you download any extra apps. And Kindle wants to limit you to their store and ecosystem. With the Wave, you can read ebooks via apps including Kindle, Kobo, Libby, and Hoopla to name a few. If you care about other apps and doing things beyond reading and writing, then a full-fledged e-ink tablet from Onyx&rsquo;s Boox line may be more up your alley. But keep in mind the Boox devices are much more expensive than the MobiScribe Wave (and most of the other devices mentioned in this post).</p>\n<h2 id=\"initial-setup\">Initial setup</h2>\n<p>After connecting to WiFi, I downloaded the tolino app for ebooks and the Adobe PDF app. You can download these apps from the MobiStore app&ndash;no account required.</p>\n<p>Then I transferred my ebooks via USB-C and I was ready to go. (<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you&rsquo;re using a Mac, you&rsquo;ll have to download the Android File Transfer app. Sometimes I have to connect the device multiple times before the app works.

				"content_text": "\n*The MobiScribe Wave isn't the best e-ink device out there. But it might be all you need.*\n\n---\n\nOver the last few weeks, I've fallen in love with the MobiScribe Wave. Because the device is an interesting mix of value and compromises, you should do your research before you buy. \n\nThis post is less technical than you'll find on most other reviews. I hope to instead give practical perspective to inform your buying decision. The MobiScribe Wave is not a premium device in the same class as the Remarkable 2, Kindle Scribe, or Ratta Supernote. But depending on your usage, the Wave may be all you need.\n\nWhile using the Wave as my main writing and reading device for the last month or so, I've become well-acquainted with its limitations. But I still love the device despite its flaws.\n\n## Why I bought the MobiScribe Wave\nI'd had my eye on an e-ink writing tablet for a while now. But at times I couldn't help feeling I wanted one only because I wanted a new toy, and that buying such a device would be a waste of money. \n\nComparable e-ink writing tablets from MobiScribe's competitors are significantly more expensive than the Wave--some over twice as much, depending on what specs and accessories you get. \n\nLater in this post you'll find a brief comparisons of the Wave and its competitors; hopefully then you'll understand why I was reluctant to splurge on a device I wasn't sure was truly for me. I was tempted to stick with old fashioned pen and paper. But the old ways weren't working out great on my morning and evening train commutes.\n\nWith physical notebooks, I struggle with keeping different types of writing separate in their own notebooks. But it's often more convenient to carry only one notebook. With the MobiScribe Wave, I can now have the best of both scenarios, at a great price. \n\nWith an e-ink notebook, I can switch between reading and writing in a snap, within the same device. And reading my writing partner's stories on my Wave is way easier than reading them on my tiny phone screen (iPhone SE). Also, on my phone, it's too easy to find something else to do with so many apps at my fingertips. So, for a while, I was printing my writing partner's stories out. Making notes on an 8.5\" x 11\" piece of paper is inconvenient at the best of times on the train, but even more so on those days where it's standing room only.\n\nHaving everything I need on one device cuts down on the number of items I carry in my laptop bag. Each book, notebook, pen, pencil, eraser, etc., adds weight and bulk. Maybe I'd feel differently if I got to call my own shots and could work when and where I wanted. But I instead sold my soul to The Man, so the MobiScribe Wave is a great device for me.\n\nI resisted the urge to buy an e-ink writing tablet for a while. But when Cal Newport kept singing the praises of his Remarkable 2 on the Deep Questions Podcast[^cal], I could no longer resist. And a certain YouTube video from Voja of My Deep Guide[^voja] convinced me the Wave was worth taking a chance on.\n\n## What you get\nBelow is **what you receive when you buy the MobiScribe Wave:**\n- The MobiScribe Wave e-ink notebook.\n- MobiScribe's standard Stylus.\n- Cover for the device.\n- USB-C cable for charging and file transfer (wall plug not included). \n\n### The primary device\nThe primary device feels solid. \n\nThe back has indentions on the side which make it easy to hold. \n\nI wasn't sure I'd like having a recessed screen, especially because I'd gotten used to a flush screen on my Kindle Oasis (before my wife decided she wanted to start reading again and basically stole my Oasis, thereby justifying my purchase of the Wave). But I'm happy to report the recessed screen hasn't been an issue. In fact, I've forgotten it's even an aspect of the device.\n\n64GB of storage is very generous at this price point. More expensive devices come with much less storage.\n\nThe front light is one of those features that most e-reader fans likely take for granted. But, when you consider that no versions of the Remarkable 2 include a front light, you realize what a luxury it is.\n\n### Stylus\nThe stylus is fine. \n\nFrom what I've read online, the stylus doesn't give as much feedback as the Remarkable 2's stylus, which may be an issue for some users. The good news is that the Wave is compatiable with most styluses that use Wacom EMR technology, so you can switch out for a better stylus if you like.\n\nHaving an eraser on the end of the stylus is nice. But I can't help wanting to rub when I erase--like you'd expect to do with a pencil eraser--and I'm pretty sure that's how I scratched my screen. The scratches aren't bad and I don't find them distracting. But it's disappointing that I'm already seeing cosmetic wear and tear after only a month of ownership.\n\nI replaced the nib after three weeks of usage. I haven't had the device long enough to know if this will be the average lifespan for my nibs. Also, your mileage may vary.\n\nAfter owning the Wave for a month, I bought the Staedtler Noris Jumbo stylus[^amazon], which is much better at a great price (~$35). The stock stylus had stopped working as expected. For some reason, it would only erase, no matter what tool was selected. My research prior to buying the Wave did not lead me to believe it's common for the stock stylus to crap out so quickly. So I can't say you should factor the cost of another stylus into the budget/risk factor. I appear to have just run into a bit of bad luck.\n\n### Case\nThe case is simple, light, and functional. \n\nThe front cover folds around with no hitches, making the device is easy to hold with one hand. The pen loop ensures you never lose your stylus. Cutouts along the top and bottom edges give access to the charging port and buttons for power and the front light.\n\nBut how well does it protect the Wave? I haven't dropped it yet, so I can't really say. But the device isn't as fragile as an iPad, which uses a glasses screen, so I imagine the case works just fine.\n\n## The MobiScribe Wave vs. similar devices\nThe complete package of the MobiScribe Wave can be tough to gauge. For $230, you get a complete bundle including the MobiScribe Wave, case, stylus, and USB-C cable. \n\nNow, let's glance at **how the MobiScribe Wave compares to its peers in terms of price and value:**\n- $450 for the cheapest bundle (device, stylus, cover) from Remarkable\n- $275 for a refurbished Remarkable (device only); $299 for new (device only)\n- Nearly $400 for a comparable Kindle Scribe bundle (with only 16GB of storage)\n- ~$550 for a similar bundle for the Supernote Ratta A5X (a comparable device to the Remarkable 2 and Kindle Scribe)\n- ~$420 for a similar bundle for the Supernote Ratta A6X (comparable in size to the MobiScribe Wave\n\n**Please note:** The prices listed here are normal MSRP and do not account for potential sales. Also, you may save money if you don't buy a full bundle.\n\nThe Wave comes with 64GB of storage. The Kindle Scribe bundles start at 16GB. The Remarkable 2 has only 8GB of storage, with no expansion options.\n\nThe Wave includes a front light, which is not available on any of the Remarkable 2 devices at any price point.\n\nNone of the Wave's competitors claim to offer waterproof devices. (Is the Wave *really* waterproof? No idea, as I don't plan on testing that feature any time soon.)\n\nThe Wave lets you download other apps via the Google Play Store. This feature helps to make the Wave a more nearly complete reading device by making it easier to check in on your RSS feeds and saved articles. As far as I know, the Remarkable 2 doesn't let you download any extra apps. And Kindle wants to limit you to their store and ecosystem. With the Wave, you can read ebooks via apps including Kindle, Kobo, Libby, and Hoopla to name a few. If you care about other apps and doing things beyond reading and writing, then a full-fledged e-ink tablet from Onyx's Boox line may be more up your alley. But keep in mind the Boox devices are much more expensive than the MobiScribe Wave (and most of the other devices mentioned in this post).\n\n## Initial setup\nAfter connecting to WiFi, I downloaded the tolino app for ebooks and the Adobe PDF app. You can download these apps from the MobiStore app--no account required.\n\nThen I transferred my ebooks via USB-C and I was ready to go. (**NOTE:** If you're using a Mac, you'll have to download the Android File Transfer app. Sometimes I have to connect the device multiple times before the app works. I don't know if this issue is unique to the Wave, or if it's typical with most Android devices and Macs.\n\n**UPDATE:** Since the original post, I have since transferred books via USB-C on Fedora Onyx, which was a much smoother experience, so Linux users may have better luck.)\n\nI've also enabled the Google Play Store on the device and have downloaded apps including Firefox and wallabag.\n\n## How I've been using the MobiScribe Wave\n\n### As a writing device\nSince I got the Wave, **I've used it for every version of writing I can think of:**\n- Journal entries.\n- Short stories.\n- Blog posts.\n- Doodles.\n- Meeting notes.\n\nI've yet to find a reason to go back to physical notebooks and pens.\n\n### E-reader\nWhen it comes to reading, the Wave feels like a Kindle on steroids.\n\nAs you would expect, I can read ebooks on it. Most of the ebooks I read tend to be EPUB files. But I do read PDFs on the device as well. Being able to directly markup both EPUB and PDF files with my stylus makes it feel as if I'm reading an old fashioned printed work, but with the benefits of technology.\n\nAs I've already mentioned, downloading a couple extra apps on the Wave lets me keep up with my favorite blogs. With Firefox, I can access miniflux (my RSS service provider) and with wallabag, I can catch up on my read-it-later articles.\n\n## Who the MobiScribe Wave is for\nThe Wave might be a great option for you if you're:\n- Cost conscious, whether generally or because you're not sure if you'll like this type of device and so don't want to spend too much.\n- Someone who's never used a premium alternative such as the Remarkable 2 or Kindle Scribe. (I haven't used any Remarkable or Scribe tablets aside from demoing them in the store, but in general, it's hard to take a step down if you've had something perceived as being in a higher product class.)\n- Someone who commutes or travels and you're tired of carrying multiple books, notebooks, pens, etc.\n\n## Who the MobiScribe Wave is NOT for\nYou may want to pass on the Wave if you're:\n- Someone who expects a premium experience or has already gotten used to a premium device.\n- Someone who doesn't understand the value of e-ink and may be better served by an iPad or similar full-feature tablet.\n\n## Pros\nBelow are some features that make the MobiScribe Wave a great value purchase:\n- Cost - For $230, you get a writing tablet, stylus, cover, 64 GB storage, and more.\n- Great writing experience.\n- Access to apps like Kindle and Libby that extend your reading options.\n- Unlimited paper (and the flexibility of deleting, copying, inserting, and rearranging pages however you want or need).\n\nI've already covered why I think the Wave is a great value at $230.\n\nI usually prefer more feedback when writing.

				"content_text": "\n*Building your own website isn't quite as easy as 1, 2, 3. But it ain't that much harder.*\n\n<p class=\"note\">📝 <strong>NOTE:</strong> This post is now outdated, as I've moved my site back to <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a>. But I'm leaving the post up in case it can help someone else in the future.</p>\n\n---\n\nThis weekend I got the itch to customize my personal website again.\n\n(Just FYI, if creating your own website sounds like a horrible idea, then check out mataroa.blog[^1]. You get a simple, distration-free blog with email newsletters for $9 a year. But if you instead find yourself itching for more control, then keep on reading.)\n\nI'd made plenty short-lived personal websites with GitHub Pages and Jekyll in the past. This time I wanted to try something different, so I decided to give Hugo a shot. The only previous experience I'd had with Hugo came from my micro.blog[^2] days. Before this weekend, I'd never built a Hugo site from scratch.\n\nI mostly followed a tutorial I found on someone else's blog, so this post won't be a step-by-step repeat of that wonderful resource. In the hope of saving you time and sparing you some headache, I'll instead focus on some issues left unmentioned in most tutorials for making your own site with Hugo and GitHub Pages.\n\n## The theme\nI chose the PaperMod theme because I fell in love with a fork of the Paper theme[^3] on micro.blog. The theme is simple and elegant.\n\n**A few things I love about the PaperMod theme:**\n- Social icons\n- Dark/light theme toggle\n- Post navigation at the bottom of each post\n- Search page included\n- Tags pages automatically generated\n\n## The tutorial\nI mostly relied on a tutorial by Chris J. Hart[^4]. \n\nAs I've already said, I won't be repeating his great tutorial. But I had some problems not addressed in his tutorial, so I'll cover those issues below in the addendums.\n\n## Addendums\nLet's take a look at some extra information I would include to any tutorial about building your own site with Hugo and GitHub Pages.\n\n### Put a CNAME file in the static folder\nUpdates caused my site to forget the custom domain (jakelacaze.com), so after an update, I had to re-enter my domain in the Settings panel of the repository for my site. \n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/672463c6f5.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of custom domain settings on GitHub\">\n<figcaption>Re-entering your custom domain after every update isn't the hardest thing in the world. But it's among the most annoying things in the world.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe fix ended up being to create a CNAME file (with my custom domain as its contents) inside the ```static``` folder.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/57366d9f1c.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of a CNAME file inside the static folder\">\n<figcaption>\nA screenshot of my CNAME file inside the <code>static</code> folder\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nPutting a CNAME file in the root directory didn't fix the issue. I can't say why putting the CNAME in the static folder works; I can only report the facts as far as I understand them.\n\n### Fork the theme for your submodule\nThe tutorial--and most others like it--recommends using your desired theme as a submodule.\n\nI instead ended up forking the theme so that I could easily edit it.\n\nI ran into a problem when I tried to change the theme's RSS feed to show full content rather than just a summary. I needed to change only one word, but to do so appeared to require a change from the original theme repository and developer. By forking the theme, you can make all the changes your heart desires, directly in your main branch[^5].\n\nMaybe there's a workaround if you don't fork the theme, but I couldn't find one. So, unless you already know the solution, I'd recommend forking the theme in case you want to change something later.\n\n### Confusion about the the config file name\nThe tutorial references ```config.toml``` as your config file. The convention now appears to be to use ```hugo.toml``` instead[^6].\n\nYou'll have a basic ```hugo.toml``` file when you create your site. I changed mine to ```hugo.yaml``` because I was already familiar with the YAML syntax. Just something to keep in mind . . .\n\n## See my repo for more\nFeel free to check out the repository for my personal site[^7] if you want to dig deeper into my customizations, or if you're interested in something I forgot to mention here.\n\n[^1]: [mataroa.blog](https://mataroa.blog) - Tell 'em Jake LaCaze sent you.

And who can blame them, with all the stories circulating about AI&rsquo;s great accomplishments. (P.S.

But employees are not the only ones who should be worried. Employers may find themselves wondering what they&rsquo;ll do when AI can&rsquo;t replace enough workers.</p>\n<p>The Baby Boomers, the largest generation of all time, are retiring. Generation X and Millennials are already entrenched in the workforce while Generation Z/The Zoomers are entering the workforce. So we can basically say Gen Z is tasked with replacing the Boomers.</p>\n<p>So what&rsquo;s the big deal?</p>\n<p>As Peter Zeihan is constantly reminding us, Gen Z is tiny in comparison to the Boombers<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>. Gen Z simply doesn&rsquo;t have enough bodies to replace the exiting Boomers. On top of that, Gen Z is highly educated and great with technology. Very few in Gen Z want&ndash;or have the skill&ndash;to replace the blue collar Boomers leaving the workforce. In the coming years, we can likely expect a shortage of workers in fields like plumbing, carpentry, and truck driving.</p>\n<p>Workers would be foolish not to exploit their leverage into better wages, benefits, and conditions for themselves. Despite what the prophets of AI may claim, AI is not ready to replace these missing workers.</p>\n<p>In America (and much of the West), we&rsquo;ve built our economy around cheap labor. This strategy made sense when we had the population to support it. And if there wasn&rsquo;t someone here willing to do the job, you could bet there was someone on just the other side of the border eager to take on the task. But what does our world look like when you can&rsquo;t count on imported labor when other populations are experiencing a similar decline, but at a faster rate?</p>\n<p>The anti-immigration crowd really won&rsquo;t have a leg to stand on. As David Frum has pointed out, the question isn&rsquo;t whether we should allow immigration. The question is, How much?<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup> The follow-up question is, What kind of immigration should be allowed?</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason we&rsquo;re worried about not having enough workers in the future, it sure would be nice if AI could help out a bit.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll take this chance to echo a point I&rsquo;ve made on other platforms: I&rsquo;m not concerned that AI is ready to replace humans; I&rsquo;m concerned that it isn&rsquo;t ready but people will try to make it happen anyway. Some will try to make it happen because they&rsquo;re excited by the hype. Some will make it happen because they don&rsquo;t want to pay workers. And at some point, some will make it happen because they&rsquo;re having trouble finding anyone with the proper skills to hire.</p>\n<p>It would actually help if AI were as capable as its prophets insist. AI could help fill the labor gap and save a lot of people a lot of pain. So maybe we&rsquo;ve been looking at this AI issue all wrong.</p>\n<p>If only AI really were up for the tasks as has been promised, maybe then we&rsquo;d be in for less headache in the years ahead.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>\n  \n    <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/101690/9780525566045\"> <em>Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust</em> by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis </a>\n  \n\n on Bookshop.org (Affiliate link)&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p><a href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com\">Marcus on AI</a>, Gary Marcus&rsquo;s Substack&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:3\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p><a href=\"https://zeihan.com/boomers-at-the-end-of-the-world/\">Boomers at the End of the World</a> - Peter Zeihan&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:3\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:4\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/david-frum-how-much-immigration-is-too-much/583252/\">If Liberals Won&rsquo;t Enforce Borders, Fascists Will</a> - Originally titled &lsquo;How Much Immigration is Too Much?&rsquo; (Paywalled)&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:4\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

Generation X and Millennials are already entrenched in the workforce while Generation Z/The Zoomers are entering the workforce. So we can basically say Gen Z is tasked with replacing the Boomers.\n\nSo what's the big deal?\n\nAs Peter Zeihan is constantly reminding us, Gen Z is tiny in comparison to the Boombers[^3]. Gen Z simply doesn't have enough bodies to replace the exiting Boomers. On top of that, Gen Z is highly educated and great with technology. Very few in Gen Z want--or have the skill--to replace the blue collar Boomers leaving the workforce. In the coming years, we can likely expect a shortage of workers in fields like plumbing, carpentry, and truck driving.\n\nWorkers would be foolish not to exploit their leverage into better wages, benefits, and conditions for themselves. Despite what the prophets of AI may claim, AI is not ready to replace these missing workers.\n\nIn America (and much of the West), we've built our economy around cheap labor. This strategy made sense when we had the population to support it. And if there wasn't someone here willing to do the job, you could bet there was someone on just the other side of the border eager to take on the task. But what does our world look like when you can't count on imported labor when other populations are experiencing a similar decline, but at a faster rate?\n\nThe anti-immigration crowd really won't have a leg to stand on. As David Frum has pointed out, the question isn't whether we should allow immigration. The question is, How much?[^4] The follow-up question is, What kind of immigration should be allowed?\n\nIf, for whatever reason we're worried about not having enough workers in the future, it sure would be nice if AI could help out a bit.\n\nI'll take this chance to echo a point I've made on other platforms: I'm not concerned that AI is ready to replace humans; I'm concerned that it isn't ready but people will try to make it happen anyway. Some will try to make it happen because they're excited by the hype. Some will make it happen because they don't want to pay workers. And at some point, some will make it happen because they're having trouble finding anyone with the proper skills to hire.\n\nIt would actually help if AI were as capable as its prophets insist. AI could help fill the labor gap and save a lot of people a lot of pain. So maybe we've been looking at this AI issue all wrong.\n\nIf only AI really were up for the tasks as has been promised, maybe then we'd be in for less headache in the years ahead.\n\n[^1]: {{< bookshop 9780525566045 >}} <em>Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust</em> by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis {{< /bookshop >}} on Bookshop.org (Affiliate link)\n[^2]: [Marcus on AI](https://garymarcus.substack.com), Gary Marcus's Substack\n[^3]: [Boomers at the End of the World](https://zeihan.com/boomers-at-the-end-of-the-world/) - Peter Zeihan\n[^4]: [If Liberals Won't Enforce Borders, Fascists Will](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/david-frum-how-much-immigration-is-too-much/583252/) - Originally titled 'How Much Immigration is Too Much?'

What exactly does &lsquo;present&rsquo; mean? What is the true present moment? The tangible present, or the virtual present?</p>\n<p>Are these questions as concerning for extroverts? Or, do they feel the more <em>presents</em>, the better? If you see an issue, you must then consider the costs, both the costs of being so present and also the cost of not being present. You must find your own balance and determine when and where you want to be present—or have the energy to do so. Some will try to convince you that you must be everywhere. But if you&rsquo;re everywhere, are you really ever anywhere? This is the same question I ask of those hoping to scale their presence with the help of AI. Doesn&rsquo;t being everywhere in such fashion cheapen the worth of your time and presence? Isn&rsquo;t your scarce availability the true value of your presence? Is there any added value in our <em>truly</em> being present?

				"content_html": "<p>The more I learn about nuclear, the more I become convinced it&rsquo;s the key to solving our energy woes. And Michael Shellenberger&rsquo;s <em>Apocalypse Never</em><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> may have pushed me over the edge.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://jakelacaze.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e48f33b44c.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Michael Shellenberger&rsquo;s Apocalypse Never\">\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cover of Michael Shellenberger&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apocalypse Never<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nPhoto credit: Amazon<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Why are environmentalists so strongly opposed to nuclear energy? Nuclear is abundant, clean, and energy dense. Yet so-called environmentalists (or, perhaps more appropriately, environmental alarmists) keep pushing for solar and wind, which are proven to be inefficient and terrible for the environment in their own ways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-dangers-of-environmental-alarmism\">The dangers of environmental alarmism</h2>\n<p><em>Apocalypse Never</em> is not a book about climate change denialism. Shellenberger believes in climate change and also believes humans play a role.</p>\n<p>But he argues climate change is not the same as climate catastrophe, and environmental alarmism does more harm than good.</p>\n<p>Shellenberger&rsquo;s case has merit when you look into some details of environmental alarmism.</p>\n<p>For one, enviornmental alarmists don&rsquo;t look at how we can adapt to climate change. They instead repeat the narrative that it&rsquo;s too late and that climate change can&rsquo;t be stopped. While climate change may unstoppable, it&rsquo;s not necessarily catastrophic. And if it&rsquo;s inevitable, then we should learn to live with the coming changes, which is far more productive than waving our hands in the air and declaring the end. Humans are adaptive and resilient. The sooner we start changing with the times, the better.</p>\n<p>Another aspect to consider is the hypocrisy of developed nations pushing developing nations to &ldquo;leapfrog&rdquo; straight to renewable energy while bypassing fossil fuels. Never mind the fact that sources of renewable energy such as solar and wind are expensive and not as efficient as fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>Rather than focus on holding back the developing nations, those already developed should consider how to responsibly help them progress. Developed nations should lean into alternative fuels where it makes sense, while helping developing nations improve their infrastructure with fossil fuels and then accelerate into alternative fuels. Restricting developing nations from improving their own infrastructure hurts the citizens of those nations. It&rsquo;s easy for the developed nations to push this agenda when they themselves are not affected by the policies they promote.</p>\n<p>The public narrative suggests that fans of renewable energy see the agents of fossil fuels as their enemy.

				"content_text": "\nThe more I learn about nuclear, the more I become convinced it's the key to solving our energy woes. And Michael Shellenberger's *Apocalypse Never*[^anbook] may have pushed me over the edge.\n\n![Cover of Michael Shellenberger's Apocalypse Never](https://jakelacaze.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e48f33b44c.jpg)\n<small>Cover of Michael Shellenberger's <em>Apocalypse Never</em> \nPhoto credit: Amazon</small>\n\nWhy are environmentalists so strongly opposed to nuclear energy? Nuclear is abundant, clean, and energy dense. Yet so-called environmentalists (or, perhaps more appropriately, environmental alarmists) keep pushing for solar and wind, which are proven to be inefficient and terrible for the environment in their own ways. \n\n## The dangers of environmental alarmism\n*Apocalypse Never* is not a book about climate change denialism. Shellenberger believes in climate change and also believes humans play a role.\n\nBut he argues climate change is not the same as climate catastrophe, and environmental alarmism does more harm than good.\n\nShellenberger's case has merit when you look into some details of environmental alarmism.\n\nFor one, enviornmental alarmists don't look at how we can adapt to climate change. They instead repeat the narrative that it's too late and that climate change can't be stopped. While climate change may unstoppable, it's not necessarily catastrophic. And if it's inevitable, then we should learn to live with the coming changes, which is far more productive than waving our hands in the air and declaring the end. Humans are adaptive and resilient. The sooner we start changing with the times, the better.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the hypocrisy of developed nations pushing developing nations to \"leapfrog\" straight to renewable energy while bypassing fossil fuels. Never mind the fact that sources of renewable energy such as solar and wind are expensive and not as efficient as fossil fuels. \n\nRather than focus on holding back the developing nations, those already developed should consider how to responsibly help them progress. Developed nations should lean into alternative fuels where it makes sense, while helping developing nations improve their infrastructure with fossil fuels and then accelerate into alternative fuels. Restricting developing nations from improving their own infrastructure hurts the citizens of those nations. It's easy for the developed nations to push this agenda when they themselves are not affected by the policies they promote.\n\nThe public narrative suggests that fans of renewable energy see the agents of fossil fuels as their enemy. But Shellenberger raises the possibility that these two industries instead have a shared enemy in nuclear energy.\n\nShellenberger shows example after example of environmental groups and individual advocates (such as Sierra Club and Al Gore) accepting money from fossil fuel companies, which feels like a stark contradiction to their ideology. \n\nBut, when you look for the similarities between fossil fuel companies and renewable energy companies, you find a shared hatred of nuclear energy.\n\nShellenberger then asks the logical question: \"[H]ow long, exactly, have oil and gas interests been funding environmental groups to shut down nuclear plants?\"\n\nIf nuclear is as good as advertised, then how much need would there be for other forms of energy?\n\nMuch of the opposition to nuclear energy is simply out of line.\n\nSome point to Chernobyl as a warning. But Chernobyl was more an issue of Soviet neglect than an issue of nuclear power[^chernobyl].\n\nBut what about Fukushima? Turns out neglect was an issue there as well[^fukishima]:\n\n> The tsunami countermeasures taken when Fukushima Daiichi was designed and sited in the 1960s were considered acceptable in relation to the scientific knowledge then, with low recorded run-up heights for that particular coastline. But some 18 years before the 2011 disaster, new scientific knowledge had emerged about the likelihood of a large earthquake and resulting major tsunami of some 15.7 metres at the Daiichi site. However, this had not yet led to any major action by either the plant operator, Tepco, or government regulators, notably the Nuclear & Industrial Safety Agency (NISA). Discussion was ongoing, but action minimal.\n\nThis negligence rhymes a bit with the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans, which we now know was made worse by [faulty levees](https://www.history.com/news/hurricane-katrina-levee-failures) neglected despite warnings they were inadequate for a major storm.\n\nIn each of these cases, humans could have done more to lessen the damage of these disasters. But many choose to scapegoat the disasters themselves rather than look at what we could have done better. Such negligence will only be perpetuated by the narrative that it's too late and that there's nothing we can do about our impending doom.\n\nShellnberger argues that ideology is to blame and calls environmental alarmism the new secular religion.\n\nMany have already accepted our climate apocalypse, so they look only for validation while rejecting the idea of improving our situation. Religious zealots often quote their religious tomes when referencing modern events as proof of the coming Armageddon. Environmental alarmists do much the same, except they quote choice books of science.\n\nWhen you've accepted an outcome, you default to validating it, rather than remaining open to the possibility you may be wrong. So the enviromental alarmists reject any data contradicting their gloomy predictions.\n\n## How green is renewable energy really?\nWhen you scratch beneath the surface, you start to see **issues with the renewable energy narrative**:\n\n1. How green are electric vehicles (EVs) if they're getting electricity from fossil fuels[^ev-fossilfuels]?\n2. How are the materials used for EVs, solar panels, and windmills mined, manufactured, and installed? (Most likely with the aid of fossil fuels and at great damage to their enviornments[^mining].)\n3. How can we say energy sources such as solar and wind are environmentally friendly when they're far less energy dense than fossil fuels and require much more land surface area[^density]? (Also, windmills are loud and disrupt bird habitats.)\n4. How can we call solar and wind green when recycling solar panels and windmills is an absolute nightmare? (We don't have the ability or capacity to recycle these parts, so they create more waste when they're retired[^solarpanelwaste].)\n\nTo be clear, these points do not suggest that fossil fuels are a net zero fuel source. But they do suggest that \"green\" energy may not be too much better in comparison when considering the whole picture.\n\n## Why nuclear is the answer\nAs the Office of Nuclear Energy points outs[^one], there are three reasons **nuclear energy is the way to go**:\n\n1. Nuclear is a zero-emission clean energy source.\n2. Nuclear energy produces more electricity on less land than any other clean-air source. (It's energy dense.)\n3. Nuclear energy produces minimal waste.\n\nOther forms of renewable energy such as solar and wind likely have a place in the world's future energy portfolio. But they don't deserve to be the star of the show. That honor belongs to nuclear.\n\nBut even if we universally agreed to adopt more nuclear energy, we can't just flick a switch and make it happen.\n\nBringing a new nuclear facility online takes years, sometimes nearly a decade[^nuclearconstruction]. So we can't solve our energy woes in the 2020s.\n\nBut you know the old saying: The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today.\n\nThe delayed payoff is no reason to abandon building new nuclear plants. Investing in nuclear is an investment in our energy future.\n\nIn the meantime, we should continue relying on fossil fuels to keep the world moving until we can hand the torch to nuclear.\n\n[^anbook]: [*Apocalypse Never*](https://www.amazon.com/Apocalypse-Never-Environmental-Alarmism-Hurts/dp/0063001691) on Amazon\n[^chernobyl]: ['Mismanagement at Chernobyl noted earlier'](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/13/world/mismanagement-at-chernobyl-noted-earlier.html) from *New York Times*\n[^fukishima]: ['Fukishima Daiichi Accident'](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/fukushima-daiichi-accident.aspx) from World Nuclear Association\n[^ev-fossilfuels]: ['Why electric cars are only as clean as their power source'](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/08/electric-car-emissions-climate-change#one-third-of-us-power-is-generated-by-coal) from *The Guardian*\n[^mining]: ['Will mining the resources needed for clean energy cause problems for the environment?'](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/will-mining-resources-needed-clean-energy-cause-problems-environment) on MIT's Climate Portal \n[^density]: ['Not so green: Renewable energy’s land use problem'](https://lifepowered.org/not-so-green-renewable-energys-land-use-problem/) on *Life: Powered*\n[^solarpanelwaste]: ['Solar Panels Are Starting to Die, Leaving Behind Toxic Trash'](https://www.wired.com/story/solar-panels-are-starting-to-die-leaving-behind-toxic-trash/) on *Wired*\n[^one]: ['3 Reasons Why Nuclear is Clean and Sustainable'](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/3-reasons-why-nuclear-clean-and-sustainable) on Office of Nuclear Energy\n[^nuclearconstruction]: ['How long does it take to build a nuclear reactor?'](https://hannahritchie.substack.com/p/nuclear-construction-time) by Hannah Ritchie\n",

But now, many connections are made only for the intent of increasing who sees a member&rsquo;s content, AKA <em>engagement</em>.</p>\n<p>And once users figure what gets engagement, it&rsquo;s only natural that many would start creating content in the tried-and-true formula.

A couple such examples include [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social) and [micro.blog](https://micro.blog).\n\nNetworks on LinkedIn once had value because the connections were likely to be genuine, in that you either knew the person you connected to, or you had an interest in that person. But now, many connections are made only for the intent of increasing who sees a member's content, AKA *engagement*.\n\nAnd once users figure what gets engagement, it's only natural that many would start creating content in the tried-and-true formula. So users see the same types of content over and over. Originality exists on these platforms. But it goes unseen, unrecognized, unappreciated. And so mainstream social media becomes the digital suburbs, full of cookie cutter houses lined with the same bushes and political signs.\n\n## What's the answer to social media engagement algorithms?\nWhile [web3 promises to solve all our digital woes](/blog/the-simple-math-of-web3), I find the solution to be a simple and old technology: **RSS**.\n\nWatch the video below if you're unfamiliar with the wonders of RSS:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0klgLsSxGsU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n🗒️ **Note:** This video is 15 years old, so it doesn't address that Google Reader is now dead. At only $15 a year, [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app) a great alternative. Or check out [Reeder 5](https://reederapp.com/) or [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) if you're on Mac/iOS/iPad OS.\n\n## How does RSS fix the illusion of control?\nRSS is the obvious choice for one simple reason: It doesn't give the *illusion* of control—it instead gives actual control.\n\nWith RSS, you decide what to subscribe to. You decide what's important to you. You decide what you pay attention to.\n\nYou are once again responsible for your online experience.\n\nSure, curating your experience takes a little more effort than relying on social media engagement algorithms. But it's worth it.\n",

Save formatting for the end.\n\nBesides, finding the perfect font before you start is not going to help your writing.\n\nThis is not the time to be precious about your writing.\n\n## Why iterative writing works\n\nIterative writing sets up more realistic expectations.\n\nBy demystifying the writing process and seeing how it really works, I can acknowledge that anything I put into my scrap file will likely need a ton of polish to have any chance of making it onto the launched website.\n\nI now know that my writing needs to start with an ideation phase, where I'm free to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks.\n\nAnd from there, I'll work through a series of rewrites until I feel I have something worthy of publishing.\n",

				"content_text": "Part of succeeding in the real world is unlearning what school has taught you. This is especially true with writing.\n\nSo what are some of the lessons writers need to unlearn?\n\n## Forget minimum word counts.\nSchool teaches us to drag out our writing, to string audiences along as we inflate our writing to meet some arbitrary minimum word count.\n\nEnforcing a strict *maximum* word count would be far more effective. Teachers should ask the impossible of students. Require students to argue for or against organized religion or capital punishment in 200 words. Or 100 words. \n\n*But that doesn't give me enough to work with, to make my point*, students may complain.\n\nWelcome to the real world, kid. Take your best shot with the parameters you have.\n\n## Get to the point.\nPerhaps you've heard the joke about the formula for academic writing:\n1. Tell them what you're going to tell them.\n2. Tell them.\n3. Tell them what you told them.\n\nNo.\n\nTell them—and while you're telling them, tell them why they should care. Make sure the *why* is woven throughout your writing.\n\nYour teachers will read whatever you submit because they have to. That's their job. That's what they get paid for.\n\nMost people outside the classroom do not have to read your writing. So don't assume you'll keep their attention just because you showed up.\n\n## Don't be a grammar purist.\nWriting is about communication and connection. It ain't about having the rightest sentences.\n\nYou can start sentences with conjunctions. And you shouldn't feel bad about it.\n\nDon't beat yourself up about ending a sentence with a preposition. There are more important things to worry about.\n\nFragments are fine. Really.\n\nJust be sure it works for your context and audience. (That last bit is good life advice, not just writing advice.)\n\n## Study copywriting.\nCopywriters are writers who consistently get paid for their writing. The best can turn a few everyday words into phrases that stick in an audience's mind for decades.\n\nHow do they do it? What can you learn from studying copywriting? How can you bring those lessons to your own writing?\n\n## That ain't all.\nThis is hardly a comprehensive list.\n\nBut it's somewhere to start.\n",

What is the one similarity? The unifier, other than a need to communicate?</p>\n<p>And, as we speak, my answer is: persuasion.</p>\n<p>The angle of persuasion is obvious for some fields, such as legal writing, in which briefs are intended to persuade a judge to rule in a client&rsquo;s favor. Sales copy aims to persuade you to make a certain purchase. Business emails persuade recipients to act&ndash;or maybe they persuade that no action is needed. Even research papers should aim to persuade, as we don&rsquo;t have to look too hard around us to see that facts alone are not enough. If nothing else, I have to persuade you that my facts are more accurate than your facts.</p>\n<p>But what about fiction? Where&rsquo;s the persuasion there?</p>\n<p>In fiction, authors are trying to persuade readers that this fake world with these fake people in these fake scenarios contains some sort of truth worth their time. Authors want to convince readers that this person in this situation would act or feel a certain way.</p>\n<p>And sometimes the persuasion takes a different angle, such as in the case of some of the best tellers of tall tales, the ones who stretch the truth&ndash;or, in some cases, discard the truth completely&ndash;and leave us doubled over, hoarse from laughing through the tears. Sometimes writers persuade us not to care about reality so much.</p>\n<p>In the past, I abandoned writing because I failed to see the similarities among the separate disciplines. I also failed to see that there is no down side to being a better writer. Even if you never make a penny directly from your writing, the thought and effort required to improve as a writer likely benefit you in  less obvious ways.</p>\n<p>Now, if I read something as mundane as the back of a shampoo bottle, I no longer brush it off as an irrelevant form of writing. Instead, I wonder why certain things were done certain ways and then ask if or how my own projects could benefit from those methods. This way of thinking makes me a more open-minded writer than I was when I set foot on that university campus all those years ago.</p>\n",

The unifier, other than a need to communicate?\n\nAnd, as we speak, my answer is: persuasion.\n\nThe angle of persuasion is obvious for some fields, such as legal writing, in which briefs are intended to persuade a judge to rule in a client's favor. Sales copy aims to persuade you to make a certain purchase. Business emails persuade recipients to act--or maybe they persuade that no action is needed. Even research papers should aim to persuade, as we don't have to look too hard around us to see that facts alone are not enough. If nothing else, I have to persuade you that my facts are more accurate than your facts.\n\nBut what about fiction? Where's the persuasion there?\n\nIn fiction, authors are trying to persuade readers that this fake world with these fake people in these fake scenarios contains some sort of truth worth their time. Authors want to convince readers that this person in this situation would act or feel a certain way.\n\nAnd sometimes the persuasion takes a different angle, such as in the case of some of the best tellers of tall tales, the ones who stretch the truth--or, in some cases, discard the truth completely--and leave us doubled over, hoarse from laughing through the tears. Sometimes writers persuade us not to care about reality so much.\n\nIn the past, I abandoned writing because I failed to see the similarities among the separate disciplines. I also failed to see that there is no down side to being a better writer. Even if you never make a penny directly from your writing, the thought and effort required to improve as a writer likely benefit you in  less obvious ways.\n\nNow, if I read something as mundane as the back of a shampoo bottle, I no longer brush it off as an irrelevant form of writing. Instead, I wonder why certain things were done certain ways and then ask if or how my own projects could benefit from those methods. This way of thinking makes me a more open-minded writer than I was when I set foot on that university campus all those years ago.\n",

				"title": "Untold truths about grief",
				"content_html": "<p>From time to time, someone will accuse me of having a morbid fascination with death. But <em>fascination</em> is inaccurate; my relationship with death is closer to a familiarity slowly working its way to acceptance. Death and the resulting losses and grief have had a big influence on me over the last few years. In short, loss has opened my eyes to certain realities, has shaped so many of my views, and has changed the very essence of who I am.</p>\n<p>In the Spring of 2011, my mother was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. The news came as a heavy blow. Then, a few months later, my father received a similar diagnosis: lung cancer, though a different form. If that wasn’t enough to try to deal with, the progressions of their cancers certainly were.</p>\n<p>My mother’s battle with cancer lasted seven or eight months. About four months before she ultimately passed away, she was pronounced dead when she stopped breathing for a few minutes. Per my mother’s wishes, my stepfather fulfilled the unenviable task of asking the doctor not to resuscitate her. But somehow my mother sprang back to life and continued fighting for a few more months before ultimately passing away a couple days after Thanksgiving. During that time, everyone around her watched her deteriorate and wither away. Those images still haunt me going on seven years later. As strange as this may sound, it’s easier to accept her death than it is to accept how she died. Whether logical or not, I can’t help feeling that a similar fate awaits me at some point.</p>\n<p>Unlike the case with my mother, my father passed away quickly after his diagnosis. He didn’t quite make it a month. I was scheduled to visit him two days after he passed. To make matters worse, I hadn’t seen my father in about two and a half years. So, that obviously brings its own pains and guilt that I don’t think I need to explain or elaborate.</p>\n<p>The losses didn’t stop there. In 2014, I lost my stepfather, who passed away due to complications from diabetes. Unlike the case with my parents, his death caught me completely off-guard. I knew that he was having health problems, but I had never considered the possibility of death. Or if I had, I likely felt that death would be a bit further down the road.</p>\n<p>Whenever I relay these details, I catch myself wondering if that is indeed how it happened. Even now, just the thought of having to deal with those losses in such fashion shakes me. These losses were so close together — especially the losses of my parents — and each played out in its own unique way. When I contrast and compare them, I’m able to come up with a variety of takeaways that I feel are worth sharing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"there-is-no-perfect-closure\">There is no perfect closure.</h2>\n<p>Some of us are concerned with having an ideal death. We convince ourselves that if things play out a certain way, the whole experience won’t be too painful.</p>\n<p>Each loss I suffered brought unique grief. I can’t say I fully prefer one to the other. While I’m grateful that I was able to have more time with my mother, I know every moment she was alive created pain and torture for her. I can only imagine the conflict of wanting your suffering to end but also knowing that the end will come only when you&rsquo;ve passed. Looking back, I now realize what a gift it is to have no hatchets to bury and no wrongs to right. If you have the opportunity to set things right before tragedy strikes, I highly recommend that you do it. Doing so will allow you to focus on the things that truly matter and will help to bring a little order to the chaos.</p>\n<p>I wish I’d had the opportunity to see my father one last time, but at least he didn’t have to suffer as long as my mother did. While his quick passing brings its own comforts, it also denied the opportunity for certain conversations I wish we&rsquo;d had. If I’m being completely honest and self-aware, I likely wouldn’t have had the courage to initiate these conversations, as it’s taken me nearly seven years to sort through my feelings to articulate said feelings. But as things played out, I never had the chance. And that’s something I wish I could change.</p>\n<p>And with my stepfather’s passing, I learned what it was like to be shocked when someone leaves this world without warning. There’s a big difference between accepting that someone has finally passed and accepting that someone has abruptly passed. But both situations have one thing in common–pain and suffering. You can sit around and philosophize about which flavor of grief you prefer, but at the end of the day you’re still eating a dish you wish you’d never been served. Kind of like Grandma’s <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/foodblog/2010/02/16/20-unholy-recipes-dishes-so-awful-we-had-to-make-them\">vienna sausage shortcake</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"grief-is-not-linear\">Grief is not linear.</h2>\n<p>Rather than acknowledge my grief and seek help of any sort, I repeatedly told myself that I should be over it by now. It’d been a year or two years or three years — how long was I going to take to get over these deaths? When would I be okay? When would I feel normal again?</p>\n<p>I’ve accepted I will never get over these losses. Instead, I must continue to learn to live with them. I’ve come to realize that on any given day, I have no clue what will trigger or stir a reaction in me. Just when I think it’ll never bother me again, I watch a movie or a TV show centered around the themes of death and loss and my eyes fill up. Even though I can’t articulate what exactly is going on inside, I allow myself to feel it. And that’s something that took years to find the courage to do.</p>\n<p>The journey is not straight. Along the way you’ll encounter many strange paths, and at times you may find yourself feeling as if you’re possibly regressing. That’s okay; it’s part of the process. You can’t take your hands off the wheel and just coast to the finish line; get ready for some curves and u-turns.</p>\n<p><em>The only way out is through.</em></p>\n<p>So stop <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XN0NtrnfMY\">looking forward on paths sideways</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dont-invalidate-your-grief\">Don’t invalidate your grief.</h2>\n<p>At some point, I realized I wasn’t giving myself permission to grieve. This halted my healing for years. One way I denied my grief was by telling myself that there were some who had had it far worse.</p>\n<p>*Some people lost their parents when they were much younger.</p>\n<p>Some people had lost family due to murder or wars.*</p>\n<p>Comparing and contrasting grief in this manner does little good. The fact remains that my experience still sucked, and I have no problem saying that now. When I say it, I’m not asking for pity. I’m simply acknowledging the situation.</p>\n<p><em>It sucked. It still does.</em></p>\n<p>When I think about this point, I’m always reminded of the time I heard a hospice representative ask, “What is the greatest pain the world?”</p>\n<p>The group I was in offered various answers, but the most popular answer by far was <em>the death of a child</em>. Who’s going to argue that one, right?</p>\n<p>But I now realize that the death of a child can be the greatest pain in the world only if you’ve experienced it, because as the the hospice worker made me realize when she answered her question, the greatest pain in the world is whatever pain you’re experiencing at the moment. This realization has made it easier for me to offer compassion to the pains of others as well as the pains of my own. In the end, it doesn’t matter how my pain stacks up to others’; my pain is my own, and it’s the only pain I know.</p>\n<p>Also, dealing with these kinds of matters is a balance. Yes, there are times when you have to box up your feelings and get through the day. But you do have to give yourself the opportunity to be real about how you’re feeling. Or how else can you hope to improve your feelings if you never acknowledge their true intricacies?</p>\n<h2 id=\"bring-on-the-empathy\">Bring on the empathy.</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I always cry at funerals, even if I didn’t know the person.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— My Uncle Cecil, at my grandfather’s funeral</p>\n<p>I was fifteen years old when I heard those words from my Uncle Cecil. At the time, I hadn’t had the life experience to understand and appreciate what he was saying. But I like to think I now have a much better idea, because these days I never know when a certain moment will move me to tears. Maybe the tears will come when a co-worker starts crying during her retirement party when she becomes a mess of emotions as she’s so excited to say hello to a new chapter of her life while she’s also afraid of saying goodbye to a familiar chapter. Or maybe they’ll come when I find myself an absolute mess at the end of <em>The Iron Giant</em>. (Before you ask, yes, both of those things have actually happened.)</p>\n<p>While these moments lead to embarrassment, they also allow for greater connection with others as well as with myself. Sometimes these moments are in no way obviously related to my experiences with loss. I like to think that simply being reminded time and time again about the fleeting nature of life has given me an ability to realize emotions that were once unreachable. Regardless of whether my theory is spot-on or completely vain, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee925OTFBCA\">sometimes you just need a good cry</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"death-is-something-we-need-to-talk-about-more\">Death is something we need to talk about more.</h2>\n<p>Death is inevitable, no matter how hard we try to deny it. Death is the last major event of life. We need to acknowledge this without letting fear get in the way. The least we can do is try to face our end with some dignity.</p>\n<p>For the first couple years of my son’s life, I felt bad for him because before he was even born, he’d already lost out on so much love from people expected to be close to him. While I’m still bothered by this fact, it does help to know that I have the opportunity to teach him things that most parents aren’t equipped for. I’m still not sure about the timing or the exact technique, but I do understand the importance and I know that it’s something I won’t back down from.</p>\n<p>Death and loss are part of the human experience, and we’re doing ourselves a disservice when we refuse to acknowledge that fact. Also, I like to think that as we become more comfortable with the certainty of death, we also find the clarity for better living.</p>\n<h2 id=\"it-feels-good-to-think-i-can-help-others\">It feels good to think I can help others.</h2>\n<p>One thing that lessens the pain is finding a way to come away with lessons from this experience. And it helps more if I can find a way to pass those lessons on to others who may need them. I’m aware what the pain of loss is like, and if I can help to alleviate that pain for someone else for even a tiny bit, I consider it a good deed done. I’ve also learned that it often helps to know that you’re not alone, no matter what’s ailing you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"but-if-im-being-honest-it-isnt-all-about-helping-others\">But if I’m being honest, it isn’t all about helping others.</h2>\n<p>I wish I could claim to be completely selfless. But the truth is that talking about my experience is an outlet, and finding outlets helps me. Also, every time I’m able to share my story, I find something new. I find another layer to the onion. I take away something new, and I grow just a little bit more. And so I like to think that by helping myself I’m able to help others, which may not sound very altruistic. But it’s real.</p>\n<p>Refusing to be real about this part of my life took a toll on me in many ways. It beat me down and got the best of me. It filled a significant chunk of my life with darkness and robbed me of so much potential joy. In short, it wasn’t working. And when what you’ve been trying hasn’t been working, it’s time to try something new. And this post is part of my effort to be more open about my experience.</p>\n<p>Thank you for me letting me share a bit of myself with you.</p>\n",

Regardless of whether my theory is spot-on or completely vain, [sometimes you just need a good cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee925OTFBCA)\n\n## Death is something we need to talk about more.\n\nDeath is inevitable, no matter how hard we try to deny it. Death is the last major event of life. We need to acknowledge this without letting fear get in the way. The least we can do is try to face our end with some dignity.\n\nFor the first couple years of my son’s life, I felt bad for him because before he was even born, he’d already lost out on so much love from people expected to be close to him. While I’m still bothered by this fact, it does help to know that I have the opportunity to teach him things that most parents aren’t equipped for. I’m still not sure about the timing or the exact technique, but I do understand the importance and I know that it’s something I won’t back down from.\n\nDeath and loss are part of the human experience, and we’re doing ourselves a disservice when we refuse to acknowledge that fact. Also, I like to think that as we become more comfortable with the certainty of death, we also find the clarity for better living.\n\n## It feels good to think I can help others.\n\nOne thing that lessens the pain is finding a way to come away with lessons from this experience. And it helps more if I can find a way to pass those lessons on to others who may need them. I’m aware what the pain of loss is like, and if I can help to alleviate that pain for someone else for even a tiny bit, I consider it a good deed done. I’ve also learned that it often helps to know that you’re not alone, no matter what’s ailing you.\n\n## But if I’m being honest, it isn’t all about helping others.\n\nI wish I could claim to be completely selfless. But the truth is that talking about my experience is an outlet, and finding outlets helps me. Also, every time I’m able to share my story, I find something new. I find another layer to the onion. I take away something new, and I grow just a little bit more. And so I like to think that by helping myself I’m able to help others, which may not sound very altruistic. But it’s real.\n\nRefusing to be real about this part of my life took a toll on me in many ways. It beat me down and got the best of me. It filled a significant chunk of my life with darkness and robbed me of so much potential joy. In short, it wasn’t working. And when what you’ve been trying hasn’t been working, it’s time to try something new. And this post is part of my effort to be more open about my experience.\n\nThank you for me letting me share a bit of myself with you.\n",

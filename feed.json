				"content_text": "<p>Only a few days ago, Manton Reece dropped a bomb on the micro.blog community: Subscribers of micro.blog Premium would continue to enjoy the perks they’ve come to know and love for not just one blog—and not two or three or four blogs—but for <strong>five</strong> blogs<sup><a href=\"#fn1-1277\" id=\"fnr1-1277\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>This pricing change is a rare example of a top-tier service getting better and offering even more value to its customers.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s dig a bit more into the value of micro.blog Premium, both in what it offers and what it <em>doesn’t offer</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>The value is what micro.blog offers</h2>\n\n<p>micro.blog Premium was a great deal before the change. But now we can argue it’s one of the best values on the whole of the internet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>micro.blog Premium features include</strong> but are not limited to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Blog hosting.</li>\n<li>Podcast feed.</li>\n<li>Email newsletters.</li>\n<li>Cross-posting to select social networks.</li>\n<li>A built-in network of other bloggers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now multiply that times <strong>five</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>But not the price. The price stays the same at $10 a month<sup><a href=\"#fn2-1277\" id=\"fnr2-1277\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>. Pretty awesome.</p>\n\n<h2>The value in what micro.blog does NOT offer</h2>\n\n<p>micro.blog is a unique platform in that what it doesn’t offer may be just as valuable as what it does offer.</p>\n\n<p>Below are <strong>some things intentionally missing from micro.blog</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Social media engagement algorithms</li>\n<li>Likes</li>\n<li>Follower counts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Social media engagement algorithms have made it hard to keep up with content and sources we really care about. Likes and follower counts have skewed our perception of what’s worth sharing.</p>\n\n<p>But you won’t find these features (or bugs?) on micro.blog. You can follow other users, but they won’t really know unless you tell them. The same goes for any of their posts you <em>like</em>—you’ll have to actually tell them you like their posts, in your own words. The act takes a little bit of work, but it really goes a long way.</p>\n\n<h2>micro.blog is an awesome slice of the internet</h2>\n\n<p>With micro.blog, your personal domain is your home on the internet. And with generous pricing, they’re giving users more reason to upgrade to Premium.</p>\n\n<br><br>\n\n<p><em>Jake LaCaze loves praising tech companies for doing things right.

				"content_text": "<p>Yesterday I had an idea for a mock LinkedIn influencer. He’d be a tech bro dubbed the <em>SaaShole</em>, who would serve as a blueprint for how <strong>not</strong> to do tech marketing.</p>\n\n<p>The character would be a mix of Dexter Guff, from the satirical podcast <em>Dexter Guff is Smarter Than You (And You Can Be Too)</em><sup><a href=\"#fn1-24053\" id=\"fnr1-24053\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, and Dom Mazzetti, from the <em>BroScience</em> YouTube channel<sup><a href=\"#fn2-24053\" id=\"fnr2-24053\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/K533nLM0tzw' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Or, if someone wanted to take a more sincere approach, they could call the program <em>Don’t Be a SaaShole</em> and share examples of how not to be a SaaShole.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, a quick Google search killed my ambitions, as I discovered the <em>SaaSholes</em> podcast<sup><a href=\"#fn3-24053\" id=\"fnr3-24053\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<h2>What is a SaaShole anyway—and why shouldn’t I be one?</h2>\n\n<p>I would define a <em>SaaShole</em> as a tech bro (or sis) who talks only in tech jargon to make him-or-herself sound smart rather than focus on solving a customer’s problems.</p>\n\n<p>The SaaShole wants to sell his solution to make a quick buck, not to make anyone else’s life easier. Whatever your industry, you’re in business to serve your customers or clients. If you’re not doing that, then why the hell should you expect to stay in business? Why should anyone continue to give you their money if they’re not really getting anything back in return?</p>\n\n<p>The SaaShole is a mindset. Despite its specific name, the SaaShole mindset doesn’t apply only to those in SaaS. It applies to tech all the way up and down the industry.</p>\n\n<p>Often, tech companies are selling tech solutions to non-tech people—people who don’t identify as working in <em>the tech industry</em>. So tech bros (and sisses) are often better off assuming their customers know little about tech beyond how to check their email on their smartphone, because these customers aren’t concerned about the tech—they’re concerned about solving an issue and completing a task that they don’t view through the lens of technology. If tech can help them, great—they’re all for the help. </p>\n\n<p>But for them, tech is a means to an end, not the end itself. (The good news is that if you’re wrong in assuming that your customers know next to nothing about tech, you can always deepen the technical explanations to meet them where they are. Starting with the default assumption your customers don’t know much about tech and then ramping up seems a better strategy than bombarding them with more they can handle and then trying to bring it down to their level.)</p>\n\n<p>I’ve previously written about how I think tech suffers from a lack of philosophy beyond ‘Move fast and break things’<sup><a href=\"#fn4-24053\" id=\"fnr4-24053\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">4</a></sup>. Consider this post an addendum.</p>\n\n<p>And lastly, if you work in tech, please don't be a SaaShole.

				"content_text": "<p>This post is not a straight-up ‘MobiScribe Wave vs. Kindle Scribe’ kind of post because I can’t compare the devices themselves. As I said in my MobiScribe perspective post <sup><a href=\"#fn1-21982\" id=\"fnr1-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, I’ve only demoed the Kindle Scribe at my local Best Buy. But, as someone who’s used numerous Kindle e-ink readers over the years, I can speak to the advantages of the MobiScribe Wave over the Kindle ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>And with that said, let’s get to it.</p>\n\n<h2>The limitations of the Kindle ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p>With the Kindle Scribe—like any other Kindle e-ink device—you are not buying a device that opens the door to other platforms; you are instead buying into a limited ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>Out of the box (and hacking solutions aside), you can’t download other apps for reading content outside of purchases made directly from Kindle. </p>\n\n<p>Apple often gets flak for the walled garden aspects of its own ecosystem, especially on iPhone and iPad devices. But to Apple’s credit, at least they do let you download apps outside their ecosystem, though to be fair, those same apps may not be the easiest to use, as is the case with apps that can sync to Apple’s mobile devices only via iCloud. (Obsidian comes to mind<sup><a href=\"#fn2-21982\" id=\"fnr2-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>. To sync Obsidian with mobile devices, you have only two options: iCloud and Obsidian Sync. At a cost of $8 per month, Obsidian Sync isn’t a great alternative for everyone.) The point is that Apple’s ecosystem has its issues, but it’s nothing compared to Kindle’s.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of apps and functionality, if you go with the Kindle Scribe, you better be completely satisfied with the Kindle ecosystem because the Kindle e-ink devices are basically gateways <em>only</em> to Amazon content. By default—again assuming you haven’t hacked the device—all your content comes from the Kindle Store. You do have the option to transfer ebooks from your computer, which would most likely require stripping the DRM, unless you got the books already DRM-free. But most normies aren’t going to go that route.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Fortunately, you can still save money on ebooks via the Kindle if your library offers access to the Libby app<sup><a href=\"#fn3-21982\" id=\"fnr3-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>. </p>\n\n<h2>The flexibility of the MobiScribe ecosystem—or lack thereof</h2>\n\n<p>Android tablets, including the MobiScribe Wave, give you plenty options for downloading other apps for reading various written content. </p>\n\n<p>With the Wave, as is the case with other Android tablets, the Kindle Store is simply another option. The device comes with the option to easily download the Kindle app via the MobiStore. But you can also enable Google Play and download other apps, which may save you some money. </p>\n\n<p>As a personal example, I recently figured out how to read current issues of <em>The Economist</em> via the Houston Public Library <sup><a href=\"#fn4-21982\" id=\"fnr4-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> and the PressReader<sup><a href=\"#fn5-21982\" id=\"fnr5-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> app available from Google Play, saving me over $200 a year. With the Kindle, I can read ebooks and publications only if I can purchase or subscribe to them via the Kindle store. Because <em>The Economist</em> recently cut off access via the Kindle store, I have no option to read the magazine on the Kindle, no matter how much I’m willing to pay.</p>\n\n<p>The Wave also lets me download RSS apps and read-it latter apps so that I can keep up with my digital sources, if I so choose. Kindle devices provide no such option, a limitation which keeps them from being the <em>ultimate</em> reading devices.</p>\n\n<h2>Is the Kindle ecosystem all you need?</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the Kindle Scribe is fine if you plan to use it only as it is often promoted: A device first for reading Kindle books and second for some basic writing capabilities. Even though the MobiScribe Wave is, for me, first and foremost an e-ink writing tablet, I still appreciate the reading options it gives me. Having the option to download and read from an app other than Kindle makes the MobiScribe Wave a more capable reading device.</p>\n\n<p>When I’m ready to upgrade my e-ink writing tablet, I’ll likely look again to MobiScribe (maybe the soon-to-be-released MobiScribe Wave Color Kaleido 3<sup><a href=\"#fn6-21982\" id=\"fnr6-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">6</a></sup>), or one of the many e-ink tablets offered by Boox<sup><a href=\"#fn7-21982\" id=\"fnr7-21982\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">7</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>Jake LaCaze is totally an e-ink stan.</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-21982\">\n<p><a href=\"https://jakelacaze.com/2023/11/30/mobiscribe-wave-bw.html\">MobiScribe Wave B&W - More perspective than review</a> on <a class=\"autolink\" href=\"https://jakelacaze.com\">jakelacaze.com</a> <a href=\"#fnr1-21982\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-21982\">\n<p><a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Sync+your+notes+across+devices#Sync+your+notes+on+iPhone+and+iPad\">Sync your notes across devices</a> on Obsidian Help <a href=\"#fnr2-21982\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn3-21982\">\n<p><a href=\"https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6144.htm\">Libby</a> <a href=\"#fnr3-21982\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn4-21982\">\n<p>All Texas residents are eligible for a Houston Public Library digital card.

The internet itself wasn&rsquo;t a total waste; there was just a lot of fat that needed to be trimmed so that we could focus on the useful parts.</p>\n<p>The same logic applies to AI.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of us can get behind the thought of AI having an impact beyond the burst of the bubble.

				"content_text": "\n*I don't know what's ahead for tech in 2024. But that doesn't mean I won't be thinking about it.*\n\n---\n\nA career in the volatile oil and gas industry has cured me of any thoughts on making bold predictions. So instead I’ll look at what may happen (instead of what I think will happen) and what I’d like to happen for tech in 2024.\n\n## Will the generative AI bubble burst?\nIt’s too hard to say if the generative AI bubble will burst in 2024. But I certainly hope it will. My reasons have been well-documented on this site. For one, I fear the developers of generative AI are too busy trying to sell their non-human-focused solutions rather than solving problems that could help real people[^aibubble].\n\nIf a career in oil and gas has taught me one thing, it’s that ‘boom’ is often another word for ‘bubble.’ And bubbles burst eventually. 2023 brought a great boom for generative AI. Might 2024 bring the bust?\n\nFingers crossed.\n\nLet's say the bubble does burst. *What follows?*\n\nWhat will the shakeout look like? What developments will stick around?\n\nThe internet didn't go away when the dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s. The internet itself wasn't a total waste; there was just a lot of fat that needed to be trimmed so that we could focus on the useful parts.\n\nThe same logic applies to AI.\n\nI'm sure many of us can get behind the thought of AI having an impact beyond the burst of the bubble. But as Chuck Klosterman pointed out in *But What If We're Wrong?*[^klosterman], we run into problems when we try to get more specific with such prediction.\n\n## Is 2024 the year to regain control of your digital home?\nWith the rise of social media, personal homepages became less important.\n\nBut now with the chaos of Twitter/X, many people are re-thinking their stances on owning their digital home spaces. Many of those same people don’t want to trade one dumpster fire for another by leaning on Meta-owned platforms. So they're looking for niche, sometimes indie, solutions.\n\nMany are opting to invest in homepages again.\n\nI spent the last quarter of 2023 setting up my own digital home at jakelacaze.com. 2024 is the year I’ll settle in and hopefully more consistently blog (and maybe include other types of content).\n\nI don’t know if I’ll ever abandon social media. LinkedIn helps with finding new jobs. And experimenting with platforms like Bluesky adds variety to the online experience. But I know my own webpage should remain my digital focus and that I should use other tools only insofar as they don’t distract me from my own platform.\n\nI hope more people will join along so that we can make the web weird--and therefore, *fun*--again.\n\n## Could Logseq be a useful personal knowledge management system?\nI’ve given Obsidian many tries over the years, but for some reason, it never quite stuck for me.\n\nIn December I tried Logseq and am so far loving it[^logseq]. \n\nLogseq and Obsidian largely do the same thing: They both act as a ‘second brain’ where you can dump information so that you can use your limited brain power on the hard stuff.\n\nWhile Obsidian is designed around individual pages, Logseq instead focuses on bullet points. Perhaps because I once tried the bullet journal method[^bujo], thinking and organising information in terms of bullet points makes sense to me.\n\nI hope Logseq can prove to be a tool worth the time.\n\n## Here's to hoping you find a way to make tech work for you in 2024\nThe tech industry has a habit of making us bend to the tech they build.\n\nI urge you to instead look at how you can bend tech to work around you. Maybe that requires rethinking how you use tech. Maybe it requires simplifying usage.

				"content_html": "<p>I recently sold a couple laptops (Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and Lenovo ThinkPad X270), so I was looking for another laptop to take to the coffee shop or on those rare occasions I go out of town. I didn’t want to break the bank, and while I was looking into how cheap/old of a MacBook I could make do with, I impulsively bought a 2012 MacBook Air 5,2.</p>\n<p>So now I’ll definitely get some hipster cred while I’m sipping my mocha at the local cafe. But how well will the laptop serve me?</p>\n<h2 id=\"price\">Price</h2>\n<p>I’ve wanted an Apple laptop for a while, but I couldn&rsquo;t justify the cost. Then I decided to take a chance with this old MacBook. Worst case scenario, I’d have a fun device for running Linux.</p>\n<p>So I ended up with this MacBook Air from eBay for ~$106, after shipping and tax.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>My purchase was a bit hasty, and I’m sure I could have found a better deal if I’d taken my time. But oh well, here we are, so let’s focus on what we&rsquo;ve got and not what could have been.</p>\n<p>I considered a Chromebook but wasn’t sure if I really wanted to move into that ecosystem, especially because I’m already partially in the Apple ecosystem. Chromebooks regularly come with only 4GB RAM and low-powered CPUs, and chances are they’ll still cost you at least $200.</p>\n<p>I also considered getting an iPad, but the cheapest new iPad was ~$250 this holiday season. If I’d gone that route, I most likely would have bought a keyboard case to go with it, likely pushing me past $300 total.</p>\n<p>I could have come up with the money for something I truly <em>needed</em>. But this was more of a toy purchase. I had some money burning a hole in my pocket after I sold my Nintendo 2DS, so I was happy to pull the trigger if I could basically break even. But I didn&rsquo;t want to spend much more than what I&rsquo;d made by letting go of a device I rarely used.</p>\n<p>So let&rsquo;s see what I got.</p>\n<h2 id=\"loose-specs\">Loose specs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>MacBook Air 5,2 (2012 model)</li>\n<li>4GB RAM</li>\n<li>128 GB SSD</li>\n<li>1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 2.8GHz)</li>\n<li>USB 3.0 (x2)</li>\n<li>MagSafe charger</li>\n<li>SD card reader</li>\n<li>Headphone jack</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It ain’t got the shiniest features, but it’s got most (if not all) I need.</p>\n<p>Many newer computers save space by abandoning USB 3.0 ports and using only USB-C ports. But I was surprised at just how sleek this pre-USB-C laptop still feels as we&rsquo;re leaning into 2024.</p>\n<h2 id=\"condition\">Condition</h2>\n<p>You get what you pay for. So surely this thing must be falling apart, right? Not quite.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cosmetics\">Cosmetics</h3>\n<p>I have a hard time believing this MacBook Air is over 10 years old.  I have to look hard to find the scuffs and scratches on the outer shell.</p>\n<p>I can see a dent with the lid closed.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>But not bad for a laptop over a decade old that&rsquo;s had a few miles put on it.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, I can’t complain about the cosmetics of this laptop.</p>\n<h3 id=\"battery\">Battery</h3>\n<p>I should have asked the seller about the condition of the battery. (And I wish the seller had disclosed that it needed replacing.) But I found a replacement battery for ~$30 on eBay. Replacing the battery was a breeze and probably took about 15 minutes. So all in all, not too shabby.</p>\n<p>I seem to be getting around three hours of battery life between charges. That sounds weak when compared to newer laptops that routinely get well over 10 hours of battery life. But it&rsquo;s way better than what I was getting with the old battery (I might have been lucky to have gotten an hour).</p>\n<p>But I&rsquo;m rarely in a situation in which I absolutely must go more than three hours without charging. And if I&rsquo;m in such a situation, keeping my computer running is probably not high on my list of priorities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"keyboard\">Keyboard</h3>\n<p>When people talk about old MacBooks, they often want to know whether the keyboard features butterfly switches or scissor switches. But when it comes to this keyboard, I instead find myself thinking about how I overlooked the fact that this keyboard doesn’t feature the standard American layout.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I bought some keyboard stickers for ~$6 on Amazon to help me out. And I’m adjusting to the small, oddly-shaped Enter key.</p>\n<p>It’s not perfect, but it’s nothing I can’t adapt to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-about-that-outdated-macos\">What about that outdated MacOS?</h2>\n<p>This MacBook Air is officially supported only up to MacOS 10.15.7 (Catalina), which received its last update back in July 2022.</p>\n<p>For a while, I experimented with a few flavours of Linux. Solus OS was beautiful and smooth. But I got tired of dealing with the usual Linux issues. Certain apps aren’t available. I thought I could overcome the lack of iCloud support with the help of Syncthing, but every file change seemed to bring a wave of sync conflicts. I don’t want to put a ton of work into making Linux work for me on my personal desktop. I instead want to focus on writing and creating.</p>\n<p>So I settled on MacOS. Thanks to OpenCore Legacy Patcher, I was able to update to MacOS 12.7.2 (Monterey)<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. I could have tried upgrading to Sonoma, but I decided to hold back to the oldest officially updated MacOS because this laptop has only 4GB RAM.</p>\n<p>I’m quite impressed with the ease of installing an unsupported OS with OpenCore Legacy. So far, I have no issues to report. And it’s breathing new life into a perfectly capable device that Apple deems no longer worth updating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-usable-will-this-macbook-air-be-in-2024-and-beyond\">How usable will this MacBook Air be in 2024 and beyond?</h2>\n<p>This laptop has some limitations, perhaps most notably the 4GB RAM.</p>\n<p>4GB RAM may be fine for a Chromebook, but for most other computers, you really want at least 8GB. But if I’m honest about my needs, I could likely get by on 4GB RAM for a while yet.</p>\n<p>The duo-core CPU is also a bit of a concern.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the RAM is soldered, so I can’t replace it. And replacing a CPU on a laptop is often equally hopeless. So I’m stuck with these limitations as long as I keep the laptop.</p>\n<p>The good news is that I’d wager I spend 80% of my computer time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading RSS feeds.</li>\n<li>Checking email.</li>\n<li>Watching YouTube videos.</li>\n<li>Writing.</li>\n<li>Basic photo editing (resizing and cropping).</li>\n<li>Updating my website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So it’s not as if I need a beast of a machine for my daily use. Sure, it’d be nice to have more power. But I think I’ll get by just fine. If I do need a more capable computer, I’m lucky to have a newer Mac mini available.</p>\n<p>I expect this laptop to serve me well as a secondary mobile machine for at least a couple extra years, at which point maybe I’ll replace it with a machine from 2015. Maybe 2016 if I really feel like splurging.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Jake LaCaze really likes the idea of thrifting as he gets older.</em></p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p><a href=\"https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/\">OpenCore Legacy Patcher</a>&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

But I didn't want to spend much more than what I'd made by letting go of a device I rarely used.\n\nSo let's see what I got.\n\n## Loose specs\n- MacBook Air 5,2 (2012 model)\n- 4GB RAM\n- 128 GB SSD\n- 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 2.8GHz)\n- USB 3.0 (x2)\n- MagSafe charger\n- SD card reader\n- Headphone jack\n\nIt ain’t got the shiniest features, but it’s got most (if not all) I need.\n\nMany newer computers save space by abandoning USB 3.0 ports and using only USB-C ports. But I was surprised at just how sleek this pre-USB-C laptop still feels as we're leaning into 2024.\n\n## Condition\nYou get what you pay for. So surely this thing must be falling apart, right? Not quite.\n\n### Cosmetics\nI have a hard time believing this MacBook Air is over 10 years old.  I have to look hard to find the scuffs and scratches on the outer shell. \n\nI can see a dent with the lid closed.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"uploads/2024/2eb1acde05.jpg\" alt=\"Dent in the 2012 MacBook Air\">\n\t<figcaption>A slight dent</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nBut not bad for a laptop over a decade old that's had a few miles put on it.\n\nOtherwise, I can’t complain about the cosmetics of this laptop.\n\n### Battery\nI should have asked the seller about the condition of the battery. (And I wish the seller had disclosed that it needed replacing.) But I found a replacement battery for ~$30 on eBay. Replacing the battery was a breeze and probably took about 15 minutes. So all in all, not too shabby.\n\nI seem to be getting around three hours of battery life between charges. That sounds weak when compared to newer laptops that routinely get well over 10 hours of battery life. But it's way better than what I was getting with the old battery (I might have been lucky to have gotten an hour).\n\nBut I'm rarely in a situation in which I absolutely must go more than three hours without charging. And if I'm in such a situation, keeping my computer running is probably not high on my list of priorities.\n\n### Keyboard\nWhen people talk about old MacBooks, they often want to know whether the keyboard features butterfly switches or scissor switches. But when it comes to this keyboard, I instead find myself thinking about how I overlooked the fact that this keyboard doesn’t feature the standard American layout. \n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"uploads/2024/e759303d6b.jpg\" alt=\"A picture of a 2012 MacBook Air with a non-American keyboard\">\n<figcaption>2012 MacBook Air with a non-America keyboard - Picture from original eBay listing</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI bought some keyboard stickers for ~$6 on Amazon to help me out. And I’m adjusting to the small, oddly-shaped Enter key.\n\nIt’s not perfect, but it’s nothing I can’t adapt to.\n\n## What about that outdated MacOS?\nThis MacBook Air is officially supported only up to MacOS 10.15.7 (Catalina), which received its last update back in July 2022.\n\nFor a while, I experimented with a few flavours of Linux. Solus OS was beautiful and smooth. But I got tired of dealing with the usual Linux issues. Certain apps aren’t available. I thought I could overcome the lack of iCloud support with the help of Syncthing, but every file change seemed to bring a wave of sync conflicts. I don’t want to put a ton of work into making Linux work for me on my personal desktop. I instead want to focus on writing and creating.\n\nSo I settled on MacOS. Thanks to OpenCore Legacy Patcher, I was able to update to MacOS 12.7.2 (Monterey)[^opencore]. I could have tried upgrading to Sonoma, but I decided to hold back to the oldest officially updated MacOS because this laptop has only 4GB RAM.\n\nI’m quite impressed with the ease of installing an unsupported OS with OpenCore Legacy. So far, I have no issues to report. And it’s breathing new life into a perfectly capable device that Apple deems no longer worth updating.\n\n## How usable will this MacBook Air be in 2024 and beyond?\nThis laptop has some limitations, perhaps most notably the 4GB RAM. \n\n4GB RAM may be fine for a Chromebook, but for most other computers, you really want at least 8GB. But if I’m honest about my needs, I could likely get by on 4GB RAM for a while yet. \n\nThe duo-core CPU is also a bit of a concern.\n\nUnfortunately, the RAM is soldered, so I can’t replace it. And replacing a CPU on a laptop is often equally hopeless. So I’m stuck with these limitations as long as I keep the laptop.\n\nThe good news is that I’d wager I spend 80% of my computer time:\n- Reading RSS feeds.\n- Checking email.\n- Watching YouTube videos.\n- Writing.\n- Basic photo editing (resizing and cropping).\n- Updating my website.\n\nSo it’s not as if I need a beast of a machine for my daily use. Sure, it’d be nice to have more power. But I think I’ll get by just fine. If I do need a more capable computer, I’m lucky to have a newer Mac mini available.\n\nI expect this laptop to serve me well as a secondary mobile machine for at least a couple extra years, at which point maybe I’ll replace it with a machine from 2015. Maybe 2016 if I really feel like splurging.\n\n---\n*Jake LaCaze really likes the idea of thrifting as he gets older.*\n\n[^opencore]: [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/)\n",

				"title": "MobiScribe Wave B\u0026W - More perspective than review",
				"content_html": "<p><em>The MobiScribe Wave isn&rsquo;t the best e-ink device out there. But it might be all you need.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Over the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with the MobiScribe Wave. Because the device is an interesting mix of value and compromises, you should do your research before you buy.</p>\n<p>This post is less technical than you&rsquo;ll find on most other reviews. I hope to instead give practical perspective to inform your buying decision. The MobiScribe Wave is not a premium device in the same class as the Remarkable 2, Kindle Scribe, or Ratta Supernote. But depending on your usage, the Wave may be all you need.</p>\n<p>While using the Wave as my main writing and reading device for the last month or so, I&rsquo;ve become well-acquainted with its limitations. But I still love the device despite its flaws.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-i-bought-the-mobiscribe-wave\">Why I bought the MobiScribe Wave</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;d had my eye on an e-ink writing tablet for a while now. But at times I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling I wanted one only because I wanted a new toy, and that buying such a device would be a waste of money.</p>\n<p>Comparable e-ink writing tablets from MobiScribe&rsquo;s competitors are significantly more expensive than the Wave&ndash;some over twice as much, depending on what specs and accessories you get.</p>\n<p>Later in this post you&rsquo;ll find a brief comparisons of the Wave and its competitors; hopefully then you&rsquo;ll understand why I was reluctant to splurge on a device I wasn&rsquo;t sure was truly for me. I was tempted to stick with old fashioned pen and paper. But the old ways weren&rsquo;t working out great on my morning and evening train commutes.</p>\n<p>With physical notebooks, I struggle with keeping different types of writing separate in their own notebooks. But it&rsquo;s often more convenient to carry only one notebook. With the MobiScribe Wave, I can now have the best of both scenarios, at a great price.</p>\n<p>With an e-ink notebook, I can switch between reading and writing in a snap, within the same device. And reading my writing partner&rsquo;s stories on my Wave is way easier than reading them on my tiny phone screen (iPhone SE). Also, on my phone, it&rsquo;s too easy to find something else to do with so many apps at my fingertips. So, for a while, I was printing my writing partner&rsquo;s stories out. Making notes on an 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; piece of paper is inconvenient at the best of times on the train, but even more so on those days where it&rsquo;s standing room only.</p>\n<p>Having everything I need on one device cuts down on the number of items I carry in my laptop bag. Each book, notebook, pen, pencil, eraser, etc., adds weight and bulk. Maybe I&rsquo;d feel differently if I got to call my own shots and could work when and where I wanted. But I instead sold my soul to The Man, so the MobiScribe Wave is a great device for me.</p>\n<p>I resisted the urge to buy an e-ink writing tablet for a while. But when Cal Newport kept singing the praises of his Remarkable 2 on the Deep Questions Podcast<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, I could no longer resist. And a certain YouTube video from Voja of My Deep Guide<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> convinced me the Wave was worth taking a chance on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-you-get\">What you get</h2>\n<p>Below is <strong>what you receive when you buy the MobiScribe Wave:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The MobiScribe Wave e-ink notebook.</li>\n<li>MobiScribe&rsquo;s standard Stylus.</li>\n<li>Cover for the device.</li>\n<li>USB-C cable for charging and file transfer (wall plug not included).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-primary-device\">The primary device</h3>\n<p>The primary device feels solid.</p>\n<p>The back has indentions on the side which make it easy to hold.</p>\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d like having a recessed screen, especially because I&rsquo;d gotten used to a flush screen on my Kindle Oasis (before my wife decided she wanted to start reading again and basically stole my Oasis, thereby justifying my purchase of the Wave). But I&rsquo;m happy to report the recessed screen hasn&rsquo;t been an issue. In fact, I&rsquo;ve forgotten it&rsquo;s even an aspect of the device.</p>\n<p>64GB of storage is very generous at this price point. More expensive devices come with much less storage.</p>\n<p>The front light is one of those features that most e-reader fans likely take for granted. But, when you consider that no versions of the Remarkable 2 include a front light, you realize what a luxury it is.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stylus\">Stylus</h3>\n<p>The stylus is fine.</p>\n<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read online, the stylus doesn&rsquo;t give as much feedback as the Remarkable 2&rsquo;s stylus, which may be an issue for some users. The good news is that the Wave is compatiable with most styluses that use Wacom EMR technology, so you can switch out for a better stylus if you like.</p>\n<p>Having an eraser on the end of the stylus is nice. But I can&rsquo;t help wanting to rub when I erase&ndash;like you&rsquo;d expect to do with a pencil eraser&ndash;and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s how I scratched my screen. The scratches aren&rsquo;t bad and I don&rsquo;t find them distracting. But it&rsquo;s disappointing that I&rsquo;m already seeing cosmetic wear and tear after only a month of ownership.</p>\n<p>I replaced the nib after three weeks of usage. I haven&rsquo;t had the device long enough to know if this will be the average lifespan for my nibs. Also, your mileage may vary.</p>\n<p>After owning the Wave for a month, I bought the Staedtler Noris Jumbo stylus<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>, which is much better at a great price (~$35). The stock stylus had stopped working as expected. For some reason, it would only erase, no matter what tool was selected. My research prior to buying the Wave did not lead me to believe it&rsquo;s common for the stock stylus to crap out so quickly. So I can&rsquo;t say you should factor the cost of another stylus into the budget/risk factor. I appear to have just run into a bit of bad luck.</p>\n<h3 id=\"case\">Case</h3>\n<p>The case is simple, light, and functional.</p>\n<p>The front cover folds around with no hitches, making the device is easy to hold with one hand. The pen loop ensures you never lose your stylus. Cutouts along the top and bottom edges give access to the charging port and buttons for power and the front light.</p>\n<p>But how well does it protect the Wave?

				"content_text": "\n*The MobiScribe Wave isn't the best e-ink device out there. But it might be all you need.*\n\n---\n\nOver the last few weeks, I've fallen in love with the MobiScribe Wave. Because the device is an interesting mix of value and compromises, you should do your research before you buy. \n\nThis post is less technical than you'll find on most other reviews. I hope to instead give practical perspective to inform your buying decision. The MobiScribe Wave is not a premium device in the same class as the Remarkable 2, Kindle Scribe, or Ratta Supernote. But depending on your usage, the Wave may be all you need.\n\nWhile using the Wave as my main writing and reading device for the last month or so, I've become well-acquainted with its limitations. But I still love the device despite its flaws.\n\n## Why I bought the MobiScribe Wave\nI'd had my eye on an e-ink writing tablet for a while now. But at times I couldn't help feeling I wanted one only because I wanted a new toy, and that buying such a device would be a waste of money. \n\nComparable e-ink writing tablets from MobiScribe's competitors are significantly more expensive than the Wave--some over twice as much, depending on what specs and accessories you get. \n\nLater in this post you'll find a brief comparisons of the Wave and its competitors; hopefully then you'll understand why I was reluctant to splurge on a device I wasn't sure was truly for me. I was tempted to stick with old fashioned pen and paper. But the old ways weren't working out great on my morning and evening train commutes.\n\nWith physical notebooks, I struggle with keeping different types of writing separate in their own notebooks. But it's often more convenient to carry only one notebook. With the MobiScribe Wave, I can now have the best of both scenarios, at a great price. \n\nWith an e-ink notebook, I can switch between reading and writing in a snap, within the same device. And reading my writing partner's stories on my Wave is way easier than reading them on my tiny phone screen (iPhone SE). Also, on my phone, it's too easy to find something else to do with so many apps at my fingertips. So, for a while, I was printing my writing partner's stories out. Making notes on an 8.5\" x 11\" piece of paper is inconvenient at the best of times on the train, but even more so on those days where it's standing room only.\n\nHaving everything I need on one device cuts down on the number of items I carry in my laptop bag. Each book, notebook, pen, pencil, eraser, etc., adds weight and bulk. Maybe I'd feel differently if I got to call my own shots and could work when and where I wanted. But I instead sold my soul to The Man, so the MobiScribe Wave is a great device for me.\n\nI resisted the urge to buy an e-ink writing tablet for a while. But when Cal Newport kept singing the praises of his Remarkable 2 on the Deep Questions Podcast[^cal], I could no longer resist. And a certain YouTube video from Voja of My Deep Guide[^voja] convinced me the Wave was worth taking a chance on.\n\n## What you get\nBelow is **what you receive when you buy the MobiScribe Wave:**\n- The MobiScribe Wave e-ink notebook.\n- MobiScribe's standard Stylus.\n- Cover for the device.\n- USB-C cable for charging and file transfer (wall plug not included). \n\n### The primary device\nThe primary device feels solid. \n\nThe back has indentions on the side which make it easy to hold. \n\nI wasn't sure I'd like having a recessed screen, especially because I'd gotten used to a flush screen on my Kindle Oasis (before my wife decided she wanted to start reading again and basically stole my Oasis, thereby justifying my purchase of the Wave). But I'm happy to report the recessed screen hasn't been an issue. In fact, I've forgotten it's even an aspect of the device.\n\n64GB of storage is very generous at this price point. More expensive devices come with much less storage.\n\nThe front light is one of those features that most e-reader fans likely take for granted. But, when you consider that no versions of the Remarkable 2 include a front light, you realize what a luxury it is.\n\n### Stylus\nThe stylus is fine. \n\nFrom what I've read online, the stylus doesn't give as much feedback as the Remarkable 2's stylus, which may be an issue for some users. The good news is that the Wave is compatiable with most styluses that use Wacom EMR technology, so you can switch out for a better stylus if you like.\n\nHaving an eraser on the end of the stylus is nice. But I can't help wanting to rub when I erase--like you'd expect to do with a pencil eraser--and I'm pretty sure that's how I scratched my screen. The scratches aren't bad and I don't find them distracting. But it's disappointing that I'm already seeing cosmetic wear and tear after only a month of ownership.\n\nI replaced the nib after three weeks of usage. I haven't had the device long enough to know if this will be the average lifespan for my nibs. Also, your mileage may vary.\n\nAfter owning the Wave for a month, I bought the Staedtler Noris Jumbo stylus[^amazon], which is much better at a great price (~$35). The stock stylus had stopped working as expected. For some reason, it would only erase, no matter what tool was selected. My research prior to buying the Wave did not lead me to believe it's common for the stock stylus to crap out so quickly. So I can't say you should factor the cost of another stylus into the budget/risk factor. I appear to have just run into a bit of bad luck.\n\n### Case\nThe case is simple, light, and functional. \n\nThe front cover folds around with no hitches, making the device is easy to hold with one hand. The pen loop ensures you never lose your stylus. Cutouts along the top and bottom edges give access to the charging port and buttons for power and the front light.\n\nBut how well does it protect the Wave? I haven't dropped it yet, so I can't really say. But the device isn't as fragile as an iPad, which uses a glasses screen, so I imagine the case works just fine.\n\n## The MobiScribe Wave vs. similar devices\nThe complete package of the MobiScribe Wave can be tough to gauge. For $230, you get a complete bundle including the MobiScribe Wave, case, stylus, and USB-C cable. \n\nNow, let's glance at **how the MobiScribe Wave compares to its peers in terms of price and value:**\n- $450 for the cheapest bundle (device, stylus, cover) from Remarkable\n- $275 for a refurbished Remarkable (device only); $299 for new (device only)\n- Nearly $400 for a comparable Kindle Scribe bundle (with only 16GB of storage)\n- ~$550 for a similar bundle for the Supernote Ratta A5X (a comparable device to the Remarkable 2 and Kindle Scribe)\n- ~$420 for a similar bundle for the Supernote Ratta A6X (comparable in size to the MobiScribe Wave\n\n**Please note:** The prices listed here are normal MSRP and do not account for potential sales. Also, you may save money if you don't buy a full bundle.\n\nThe Wave comes with 64GB of storage. The Kindle Scribe bundles start at 16GB. The Remarkable 2 has only 8GB of storage, with no expansion options.\n\nThe Wave includes a front light, which is not available on any of the Remarkable 2 devices at any price point.\n\nNone of the Wave's competitors claim to offer waterproof devices. (Is the Wave *really* waterproof? No idea, as I don't plan on testing that feature any time soon.)\n\nThe Wave lets you download other apps via the Google Play Store. This feature helps to make the Wave a more nearly complete reading device by making it easier to check in on your RSS feeds and saved articles. As far as I know, the Remarkable 2 doesn't let you download any extra apps. And Kindle wants to limit you to their store and ecosystem. With the Wave, you can read ebooks via apps including Kindle, Kobo, Libby, and Hoopla to name a few. If you care about other apps and doing things beyond reading and writing, then a full-fledged e-ink tablet from Onyx's Boox line may be more up your alley. But keep in mind the Boox devices are much more expensive than the MobiScribe Wave (and most of the other devices mentioned in this post).\n\n## Initial setup\nAfter connecting to WiFi, I downloaded the tolino app for ebooks and the Adobe PDF app. You can download these apps from the MobiStore app--no account required.\n\nThen I transferred my ebooks via USB-C and I was ready to go. (**NOTE:** If you're using a Mac, you'll have to download the Android File Transfer app. Sometimes I have to connect the device multiple times before the app works. I don't know if this issue is unique to the Wave, or if it's typical with most Android devices and Macs.\n\n**UPDATE:** Since the original post, I have since transferred books via USB-C on Fedora Onyx, which was a much smoother experience, so Linux users may have better luck.)\n\nI've also enabled the Google Play Store on the device and have downloaded apps including Firefox and wallabag.\n\n## How I've been using the MobiScribe Wave\n\n### As a writing device\nSince I got the Wave, **I've used it for every version of writing I can think of:**\n- Journal entries.\n- Short stories.\n- Blog posts.\n- Doodles.\n- Meeting notes.\n\nI've yet to find a reason to go back to physical notebooks and pens.\n\n### E-reader\nWhen it comes to reading, the Wave feels like a Kindle on steroids.\n\nAs you would expect, I can read ebooks on it.

Style is what makes the audience relate to the art and the artist.\n\nAs we further integrate AI into art, are we at risk of losing those stamps of authenticity we unknowingly put in our work? Those little hints that remind our audiences that we're the authors of our own works? And if style is the most valuable thing we have, are we smart to risk losing it?\n\n---\n\n*Jake LaCaze has been been using images generated by DALL-E 2 as cover images on this blog as a joke, but he thinks this one is actually damn good.*\n",

				"content_html": "<p><em>The internet is full of people worrying about there being too much AI, too fast just around the corner. But what if there&rsquo;s not enough in a timely manner?</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>These days, people are worried about AI taking their jobs. And who can blame them, with all the stories circulating about AI&rsquo;s great accomplishments. (P.S. If you&rsquo;re looking for a counterweight to the hype, read <em>Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust</em> by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. And subscribe to Gary Marcus&rsquo;s Substack while you&rsquo;re at it.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>)</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s only natural that workers would worry about their jobs and livelihoods, when employers have a history of eliminating workers wherever they can. But employees are not the only ones who should be worried. Employers may find themselves wondering what they&rsquo;ll do when AI can&rsquo;t replace enough workers.</p>\n<p>The Baby Boomers, the largest generation of all time, are retiring. Generation X and Millennials are already entrenched in the workforce while Generation Z/The Zoomers are entering the workforce. So we can basically say Gen Z is tasked with replacing the Boomers.</p>\n<p>So what&rsquo;s the big deal?</p>\n<p>As Peter Zeihan is constantly reminding us, Gen Z is tiny in comparison to the Boombers<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>. Gen Z simply doesn&rsquo;t have enough bodies to replace the exiting Boomers. On top of that, Gen Z is highly educated and great with technology. Very few in Gen Z want&ndash;or have the skill&ndash;to replace the blue collar Boomers leaving the workforce. In the coming years, we can likely expect a shortage of workers in fields like plumbing, carpentry, and truck driving.</p>\n<p>Workers would be foolish not to exploit their leverage into better wages, benefits, and conditions for themselves. Despite what the prophets of AI may claim, AI is not ready to replace these missing workers.</p>\n<p>In America (and much of the West), we&rsquo;ve built our economy around cheap labor. This strategy made sense when we had the population to support it. And if there wasn&rsquo;t someone here willing to do the job, you could bet there was someone on just the other side of the border eager to take on the task. But what does our world look like when you can&rsquo;t count on imported labor when other populations are experiencing a similar decline, but at a faster rate?</p>\n<p>The anti-immigration crowd really won&rsquo;t have a leg to stand on. As David Frum has pointed out, the question isn&rsquo;t whether we should allow immigration. The question is, How much?<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup> The follow-up question is, What kind of immigration should be allowed?</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason we&rsquo;re worried about not having enough workers in the future, it sure would be nice if AI could help out a bit.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll take this chance to echo a point I&rsquo;ve made on other platforms: I&rsquo;m not concerned that AI is ready to replace humans; I&rsquo;m concerned that it isn&rsquo;t ready but people will try to make it happen anyway. Some will try to make it happen because they&rsquo;re excited by the hype. Some will make it happen because they don&rsquo;t want to pay workers.

				"content_text": "\n*The internet is full of people worrying about there being too much AI, too fast just around the corner. But what if there's not enough in a timely manner?*\n\n---\n\nThese days, people are worried about AI taking their jobs. And who can blame them, with all the stories circulating about AI's great accomplishments. (P.S. If you're looking for a counterweight to the hype, read *Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust* by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis[^1]. And subscribe to Gary Marcus's Substack while you're at it.[^2])\n\nIt's only natural that workers would worry about their jobs and livelihoods, when employers have a history of eliminating workers wherever they can. But employees are not the only ones who should be worried. Employers may find themselves wondering what they'll do when AI can't replace enough workers.\n\nThe Baby Boomers, the largest generation of all time, are retiring. Generation X and Millennials are already entrenched in the workforce while Generation Z/The Zoomers are entering the workforce. So we can basically say Gen Z is tasked with replacing the Boomers.\n\nSo what's the big deal?\n\nAs Peter Zeihan is constantly reminding us, Gen Z is tiny in comparison to the Boombers[^3]. Gen Z simply doesn't have enough bodies to replace the exiting Boomers. On top of that, Gen Z is highly educated and great with technology. Very few in Gen Z want--or have the skill--to replace the blue collar Boomers leaving the workforce. In the coming years, we can likely expect a shortage of workers in fields like plumbing, carpentry, and truck driving.\n\nWorkers would be foolish not to exploit their leverage into better wages, benefits, and conditions for themselves. Despite what the prophets of AI may claim, AI is not ready to replace these missing workers.\n\nIn America (and much of the West), we've built our economy around cheap labor. This strategy made sense when we had the population to support it. And if there wasn't someone here willing to do the job, you could bet there was someone on just the other side of the border eager to take on the task. But what does our world look like when you can't count on imported labor when other populations are experiencing a similar decline, but at a faster rate?\n\nThe anti-immigration crowd really won't have a leg to stand on. As David Frum has pointed out, the question isn't whether we should allow immigration. The question is, How much?[^4] The follow-up question is, What kind of immigration should be allowed?\n\nIf, for whatever reason we're worried about not having enough workers in the future, it sure would be nice if AI could help out a bit.\n\nI'll take this chance to echo a point I've made on other platforms: I'm not concerned that AI is ready to replace humans; I'm concerned that it isn't ready but people will try to make it happen anyway. Some will try to make it happen because they're excited by the hype. Some will make it happen because they don't want to pay workers. And at some point, some will make it happen because they're having trouble finding anyone with the proper skills to hire.\n\nIt would actually help if AI were as capable as its prophets insist. AI could help fill the labor gap and save a lot of people a lot of pain. So maybe we've been looking at this AI issue all wrong.\n\nIf only AI really were up for the tasks as has been promised, maybe then we'd be in for less headache in the years ahead.\n\n[^1]: {{< bookshop 9780525566045 >}} <em>Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust</em> by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis {{< /bookshop >}} on Bookshop.org (Affiliate link)\n[^2]: [Marcus on AI](https://garymarcus.substack.com), Gary Marcus's Substack\n[^3]: [Boomers at the End of the World](https://zeihan.com/boomers-at-the-end-of-the-world/) - Peter Zeihan\n[^4]: [If Liberals Won't Enforce Borders, Fascists Will](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/david-frum-how-much-immigration-is-too-much/583252/) - Originally titled 'How Much Immigration is Too Much?'

More importantly, humans have a *responsibility* in shaping that future.\n\nToo many of us accept that things will just work out. Or that they won't. Whatever our outlook, we get complacent. We take whatever we can get. We accept the future and consequences we're dealt. We blame the dealer even though we never acted on our chance to cut the deck.\n\nTechnology is not some mysterious force. There is no invisible hand of technology moving it in one direction or the other. Technology is the byproduct of our creations and the norms we create around using those creations.\n\nAt the time of this writing, AI is all the rage. I don't think AI is worthy of being injected into every aspect of our lives, but unfortunately, that doesn't mean it *won't* be injected into every area and situation possible. But this strategy is unforgivably reckless, because, as John Oliver said in his bit about AI on *Last Week Tonight*[^3]:\n\n> The problem with AI isn't that it's smart--it's that it's stupid in ways we can't always predict.\n\nOn his Substack, Gary Marcus recently echoed this sentiment when he pointed out how DALL-E 3[^4], the latest version of OpenAI's image generator, had problems showing black doctors with white patients, or a watch showing the time of 1 o'clock.[^5] We still don't know the ways in which AI has unintentional bias. And we do a disservice by presenting AI as being limitlessly intelligent, when in fact its capabilities very much depend on *how* it's trained and *what* it's trained *on*.\n\nAt the risk of becoming a broken record, I'll say it again: AI has potential. We should explore where and how it can help humanity. But we must do so in a responsible manner. We must be thoughtful and deliberate. Right now, we're being anything but.\n\nTechnology doesn't simply advance *just because*. It moves along the path we create for it. And I hope more people will start chiming in on which path we set this risky technology on. Just because there are risks involved doesn't mean there aren't great benefits waiting. But again, those benefits won't happen on their own. We must play our part in making those benefits reality.\n\n[^1]: [Walter Isaacson on Elon, X, and breaking the rules](https://megaphone.link/CAD8374507134)\n[^2]: [*Elon Musk* by Walter Isaacson](https://books2read.com/u/b5wLg7)\n[^3]: [*Last Week Tonight* on AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqa8Zo2XWc4)\n[^4]: [DALL-E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3)\n[^5]: [Race, statistics, and the persistent cognitive limitations of DALL-E](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/race-statistics-and-the-persistent)\n",

What exactly does &lsquo;present&rsquo; mean? What is the true present moment? The tangible present, or the virtual present?</p>\n<p>Are these questions as concerning for extroverts? Or, do they feel the more <em>presents</em>, the better? If you see an issue, you must then consider the costs, both the costs of being so present and also the cost of not being present. You must find your own balance and determine when and where you want to be present—or have the energy to do so. Some will try to convince you that you must be everywhere. But if you&rsquo;re everywhere, are you really ever anywhere? This is the same question I ask of those hoping to scale their presence with the help of AI.

Nuclear is abundant, clean, and energy dense. Yet so-called environmentalists (or, perhaps more appropriately, environmental alarmists) keep pushing for solar and wind, which are proven to be inefficient and terrible for the environment in their own ways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-dangers-of-environmental-alarmism\">The dangers of environmental alarmism</h2>\n<p><em>Apocalypse Never</em> is not a book about climate change denialism. Shellenberger believes in climate change and also believes humans play a role.</p>\n<p>But he argues climate change is not the same as climate catastrophe, and environmental alarmism does more harm than good.</p>\n<p>Shellenberger&rsquo;s case has merit when you look into some details of environmental alarmism.</p>\n<p>For one, enviornmental alarmists don&rsquo;t look at how we can adapt to climate change. They instead repeat the narrative that it&rsquo;s too late and that climate change can&rsquo;t be stopped. While climate change may unstoppable, it&rsquo;s not necessarily catastrophic. And if it&rsquo;s inevitable, then we should learn to live with the coming changes, which is far more productive than waving our hands in the air and declaring the end. Humans are adaptive and resilient. The sooner we start changing with the times, the better.</p>\n<p>Another aspect to consider is the hypocrisy of developed nations pushing developing nations to &ldquo;leapfrog&rdquo; straight to renewable energy while bypassing fossil fuels. Never mind the fact that sources of renewable energy such as solar and wind are expensive and not as efficient as fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>Rather than focus on holding back the developing nations, those already developed should consider how to responsibly help them progress. Developed nations should lean into alternative fuels where it makes sense, while helping developing nations improve their infrastructure with fossil fuels and then accelerate into alternative fuels. Restricting developing nations from improving their own infrastructure hurts the citizens of those nations. It&rsquo;s easy for the developed nations to push this agenda when they themselves are not affected by the policies they promote.</p>\n<p>The public narrative suggests that fans of renewable energy see the agents of fossil fuels as their enemy. But Shellenberger raises the possibility that these two industries instead have a shared enemy in nuclear energy.</p>\n<p>Shellenberger shows example after example of environmental groups and individual advocates (such as Sierra Club and Al Gore) accepting money from fossil fuel companies, which feels like a stark contradiction to their ideology.</p>\n<p>But, when you look for the similarities between fossil fuel companies and renewable energy companies, you find a shared hatred of nuclear energy.</p>\n<p>Shellenberger then asks the logical question: &ldquo;[H]ow long, exactly, have oil and gas interests been funding environmental groups to shut down nuclear plants?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If nuclear is as good as advertised, then how much need would there be for other forms of energy?</p>\n<p>Much of the opposition to nuclear energy is simply out of line.</p>\n<p>Some point to Chernobyl as a warning. But Chernobyl was more an issue of Soviet neglect than an issue of nuclear power<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>But what about Fukushima? Turns out neglect was an issue there as well<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The tsunami countermeasures taken when Fukushima Daiichi was designed and sited in the 1960s were considered acceptable in relation to the scientific knowledge then, with low recorded run-up heights for that particular coastline. But some 18 years before the 2011 disaster, new scientific knowledge had emerged about the likelihood of a large earthquake and resulting major tsunami of some 15.7 metres at the Daiichi site. However, this had not yet led to any major action by either the plant operator, Tepco, or government regulators, notably the Nuclear &amp; Industrial Safety Agency (NISA). Discussion was ongoing, but action minimal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This negligence rhymes a bit with the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans, which we now know was made worse by <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/hurricane-katrina-levee-failures\">faulty levees</a> neglected despite warnings they were inadequate for a major storm.</p>\n<p>In each of these cases, humans could have done more to lessen the damage of these disasters. But many choose to scapegoat the disasters themselves rather than look at what we could have done better. Such negligence will only be perpetuated by the narrative that it&rsquo;s too late and that there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about our impending doom.</p>\n<p>Shellnberger argues that ideology is to blame and calls environmental alarmism the new secular religion.</p>\n<p>Many have already accepted our climate apocalypse, so they look only for validation while rejecting the idea of improving our situation. Religious zealots often quote their religious tomes when referencing modern events as proof of the coming Armageddon. Environmental alarmists do much the same, except they quote choice books of science.</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;ve accepted an outcome, you default to validating it, rather than remaining open to the possibility you may be wrong. So the enviromental alarmists reject any data contradicting their gloomy predictions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-green-is-renewable-energy-really\">How green is renewable energy really?</h2>\n<p>When you scratch beneath the surface, you start to see <strong>issues with the renewable energy narrative</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How green are electric vehicles (EVs) if they&rsquo;re getting electricity from fossil fuels<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup>?</li>\n<li>How are the materials used for EVs, solar panels, and windmills mined, manufactured, and installed?

				"content_text": "So many of us have this habit of romanticizing great writing.\n\nWe dream of the genius writers sitting alone at their desks, sipping on a cappuccino as the perfect words flow from their minds through their hands and onto the page.\n\nAnd so, when we sit down for our own writing, this is the image we're seeking to emulate.\n\nRomanticizing great writing is harmful for a couple reasons:\n\n1. It makes us feel as if we can't write great works because we're not the same kind of genius.\n2. We're set up for failure because we think great writing should come so easily.\n\nGreat writing is hard. Great writing is work.\n\nAnd great writing is iterative. It comes in steps.\n\nStudy the habits of great writers enough and you'll probably read or hear the point that the secret to great writing is rewriting. That's right: Your first draft is probably not going to be on par with the idea of the genius writer in your head.\n\nSo you're going to have to write and write and write again. AKA rewrite.\n\n## Structuring for iterative writing\n\nI recently started a new job as a marketing specialist at an IT support firm. Our first order of business is to revamp our website.\n\nWe've already established a basic framework for our new website. But now we need some copy.\n\nTime to put on the writer hat.\n\nI don't want to let perfectionism get in the way of good ideas.\n\nSo I've started with a scrap file.\n\nOriginally I started writing in Notepad on Windows. Then I moved to using Markdown in Visual Studio Code.\n\nThen my boss said he wanted to see my ideas and collaborate, so I migrated the scrap file to Microsoft OneNote.\n\nAll of that to say you can structure for iterative writing in a variety of apps. Doing so doesn't require any technical ability. Instead, doing so requires the proper mindset.\n\nI have three main topics I'm juggling and trying to write copy for.\n\nSo I've structured my scrap file as follows:\n\n- Unorganized\n- Topic 1\n  - Subtopic 1.1\n  - Subtopic 1.2\n- Topic 2\n - Subtopic 2.1\n - Subtopic 2.2\n- Topic 3\n - Subtopic 3.1\n - Subtopic 3.2\n\nAs ideas pop into my head, I simply sort them underneath the appropriate topic or subtopic.\n\n“Unorganized” is just what it sounds like—that's where I keep the ideas I can't quite find a home for yet. Or maybe they pertain to parts I'm not writing for yet.\n\nThis is not the time to focus on one thing and one thing only.\n\nThis is the time to let ideas flow. I don't want to reject what may be a good idea because it doesn't fit at the moment.\n\nDon't worry too much about structure and the final product. Save formatting for the end.\n\nBesides, finding the perfect font before you start is not going to help your writing.\n\nThis is not the time to be precious about your writing.\n\n## Why iterative writing works\n\nIterative writing sets up more realistic expectations.\n\nBy demystifying the writing process and seeing how it really works, I can acknowledge that anything I put into my scrap file will likely need a ton of polish to have any chance of making it onto the launched website.\n\nI now know that my writing needs to start with an ideation phase, where I'm free to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks.\n\nAnd from there, I'll work through a series of rewrites until I feel I have something worthy of publishing.\n",
